<2tay> Let me put in simple terms why we are apologizing to the indigenous peoples. Four hundred years ago, there were already people living in Taiwan. These first inhabitants lived their lives and had their own languages, cultures, customs, and domains. But then, without their consent, another group of people arrived on these shores, and in the course of history, took everything from the first inhabitants who, on the land they have known most intimately, became displaced, foreign, non-mainstream, and marginalized.

<2tay> The success of one ethnic people can be built on the suffering of another. Unless we deny that we are a country of justice, we must face up to this history. We must tell the truth. And then, most importantly, the government must genuinely reflect on this past. This is why I stand here today.

<2tay> There is a book called "The General History of Taiwan" published in 1920. In its foreword are these words: "Taiwan had no history. The Dutch pioneered it, the Koxinga Kingdom built it, and the Qing Empire managed it." This is a typical Han view of history. The truth is that indigenous peoples have been here for thousands of years, with rich culture and wisdom that have been passed down through generations. But we only know to write history from the perspective of the dominant. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.

<2tay> Without the knowledge of the Yami tribe, the government stored nuclear waste on Orchid Island. Tribe members on the island had to suffer the negative consequences. For this, I apologize to the Yami people on behalf of the government.
<2en> sami ka vozi kanayrin maki ragiax ga payox vay ko waw mian.
<2tay> As for us women in the mountain, we really have a lot of work to do.

<2tay> So does (love the tribe) our vice chief, Afi.

<2tay> For the elderly, if they don't move around, their health is going to get worse.

<2tay> They bring back, and eat it in the same way.

<2tay> Then sowing begins.
<2en> e mamati' tovoxan ga asiki maymaw i ma'ova' a rawiq i mosa' i e tomovox gi mamati' gi vali i kinhiwan na nano' na asi panangi kia ro.
<2tay> Sowing was so hard that they must to the degree of rolling their eyes. Going sowing was hard because did not dig with anything then but they still plowed.
<2en> nha' gi paqason nha' maniq kaxavaw ko a' minowah sko mamayah ka tinovox nha'.
<2tay> Because they are all happy to eat what comes from the dry land they sowed.
<2en> e mosa' i ananano' ko waw nha' ga yako otox ko pasapongon nha'.
<2tay> Whatever matter of theirs, this God makes the decision for them.
<2en> masogagai komiyom so naniqon kahavag ko itaal roni taiwan ro.
<2tay> All the people originally living here in Taiwan then separated to look for food.
<2en> sooyi tiko hani la ga ini' paska' kahavag na'aring kia ini' paska' ko kai' ta' ka itaal ro.
<2tay> So, now we are all different from each other. Our languages of the Atayal people have all become different since then.
<2en> talan qotox qasino ga totingon ro nano yani ko siqiyanox nko sami ka itaal hani.
<2tay> If we saw a beast, we beat it, and that was what we, the Atayal people here, depended on when living.
<2en> ikia tikay ko irarawq na kahoniq ga pinangon ro ro tovoxan tikay vali kitowa' ska' sovalay tahonakan.
<2tay> If there were some areas with short trees, we cultivated them, and sowed a little bit in some areas that were not large but were really just large enough for one to sit on.
<2en> tiko pa panaqali' so qali' na kahoniq ka tatimo' rakos ga isamama'ah tikay la ga yani a timo' ro XkitkoX pring ga voway nia' ga alan so timo'.
<2tay> For the bark of trees that was salty, like that of the camphor trees, if it was a little sour, we made it into salt. For the Rhus javanica tree, its fruits were taken as salt.
<2en> ro yaho nia' la ga tatapihan.
<2tay> Down from Tinapa'an would be Tatapihan.

<2tay> Down from Tatapihan would be Nawmatah.

<2tay> No matter what, they are teaching.

<2tay> And then, Father beat the hog on the head, and we came back.

<2tay> All the four of us gathered at the hunting hut.
<2en> somiwaal la ga toliq ko tomok ka vaiqan nia' qotox samiyan so qowaw ko yava' nko olaqi' na kanayril.
<2tay> When they agree, the leader gives the girl's father a cup of wine.
<2en> novogon nia' la ga' gao aras a tawkan qinowi' i tanox la san rason vali vaqon nko olaqi' na kanayril so mosa' tomayi' mi.
<2tay> (If the father) drinks the wine, the chief will ask someone to bring in the basket hung outside, and the girl still doesn't know that someone is coming to propose.
<2en> ini' kanga' mowah gi kiya a kolo' la ro.
<2tay> You can come back quickly because now we have cars.

<2tay> The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.

<2en> tiko waw ka hani ga', baqon mo ko' pinkibaqan na' pinomowa' ro naniqon na' Yencomin ro kinma'bok ko' somko' co' qaraxqarax na' waw.
<2tay> Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.

<2tay> My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
<2en> ktalan co ni yaba mo lga, baq kmayan maha, babaw nya ga akya so bbaq calay qmalop na cqoliq.
