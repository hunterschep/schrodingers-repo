Let me put in simple terms why we are apologizing to the indigenous peoples. Four hundred years ago, there were already people living in Taiwan. These first inhabitants lived their lives and had their own languages, cultures, customs, and domains. But then, without their consent, another group of people arrived on these shores, and in the course of history, took everything from the first inhabitants who, on the land they have known most intimately, became displaced, foreign, non-mainstream, and marginalized.
The success of one ethnic people can be built on the suffering of another. Unless we deny that we are a country of justice, we must face up to this history. We must tell the truth. And then, most importantly, the government must genuinely reflect on this past. This is why I stand here today.
There is a book called "The General History of Taiwan" published in 1920. In its foreword are these words: "Taiwan had no history. The Dutch pioneered it, the Koxinga Kingdom built it, and the Qing Empire managed it." This is a typical Han view of history. The truth is that indigenous peoples have been here for thousands of years, with rich culture and wisdom that have been passed down through generations. But we only know to write history from the perspective of the dominant. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Without the knowledge of the Yami tribe, the government stored nuclear waste on Orchid Island. Tribe members on the island had to suffer the negative consequences. For this, I apologize to the Yami people on behalf of the government.
As for us women in the mountain, we really have a lot of work to do.

Then sowing begins.
Sowing was so hard that they must to the degree of rolling their eyes. Going sowing was hard because did not dig with anything then but they still plowed.
Because they are all happy to eat what comes from the dry land they sowed.
Whatever matter of theirs, this God makes the decision for them.
All the people originally living here in Taiwan then separated to look for food.
So, now we are all different from each other. Our languages of the Atayal people have all become different since then.
If we saw a beast, we beat it, and that was what we, the Atayal people here, depended on when living.
If there were some areas with short trees, we cultivated them, and sowed a little bit in some areas that were not large but were really just large enough for one to sit on.
For the bark of trees that was salty, like that of the camphor trees, if it was a little sour, we made it into salt. For the Rhus javanica tree, its fruits were taken as salt.
Down from Tinapa'an would be Tatapihan.
Down from Tatapihan would be Nawmatah.

And then, Father beat the hog on the head, and we came back.
All the four of us gathered at the hunting hut.
When they agree, the leader gives the girl's father a cup of wine.
(If the father) drinks the wine, the chief will ask someone to bring in the basket hung outside, and the girl still doesn't know that someone is coming to propose.
You can come back quickly because now we have cars.

Next time I will come with my parents.
When we were young, our family lived in Pyahaw. After I started school, we moved to Luodong and have been living in the city ever since.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
I have a classmate named Hayung, he often forgets to bring things.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
Sometimes it was a boar, sometimes a flying squirrel, and occasionally a pheasant.
My good friend's name is Yukan, and he is also an Tayal child.
My uncle and I chatted in the room, and he shared many stories.
We had arranged to visit his home this holiday for the interview.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
I have learned many Tayal languages.
My name is Amuy Pihaw.
My dad's name is Pihaw Bawxin.
I am an Atayal child.
My father is tall and he is a policeman.
We were going home too.
Our school is not big, there are not many students, everyone knows each other.
Grandma cooked a big lunch, including fish, chicken, pumpkin, and snails.
This holiday, my sister and I went to Taipei to visit my uncle.
Hayung burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
When I was little, my dad and uncle would go out at night with hunting knives and guns.
I was late for school this morning.
But I stood up and continued running forward.
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
I went out with my mother today.
I asked my mother why the sky is red.
I hope the typhoon doesn't come, I still want to go out to play again.
We will also clean every corner of the school. Everyone works together, and the school is very clean every day.

After entering the zoo, the teacher said, There are birds in the front and snakes in the back
I'm afraid of snakes, so I don't look at snakes.
Grandma thought it was too expensive and asked the boss if it could be cheaper.
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
I didn't bring anything with me.
My good friend's name is Yumin, and he is also an Tayal child.
But I stood up and continued running forward.
Before I left, my uncle praised me for growing taller and becoming more handsome.
I said, \When your foot gets better
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
Yumin Nawi said, \The names written in indigenous languages are our true names. My name represents our ethnic group

After I went to college, I took a course on aboriginal culture and learned that the aboriginal people in Taiwan have various and rich cultures.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
We invited friends and family to have a great dinner together.
When returning to the village, share the hunted prey with the tribe.
Although I didn't get first place, I'm glad because I completed the race.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
My dad's name is Baycu'.
My father speaks the ethnic language with us at home.
Mom said, maybe the typhoon is coming.
As soon as grandpa saw me, he invited me to eat watermelon and drink tea.
There are a lot of cars in the city, so we go there by motorcycle.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
My grandma and I went to the market to buy chickens and prepared a delicious dinner for my younger brother.
The owner of the nearby fruit stand said: "My pineapples and peaches are very sweet. Buy some!"
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
During the exam, a classmate lent me a pen and an eraser.
We study together in the Tabilas tribe.
My uncle injured his foot.
Yesterday, I went to the market with my grandmother to set up a stall. My grandmother brought a lot of vegetables that she grew herself and also prepared indigenous cuisine for everyone.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
On the way home, I made a wish with the stars
We haven't seen each other for a long time and I miss him a lot.
I also like grandpa's tea, it's tasted good too.
I saw a lot of birds flying around in the trees and saw owls sleeping in tree hollows.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
But the boss said that it is already very cheap and cannot be reduced any further.
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
Sometimes it was a boar, sometimes a flying squirrel, and occasionally a pheasant.
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
Dad saw it and told me that I will be a very good hunter in the future.
My good friend's name is Silan, and he is also an Tayal child.
I said, When your foot gets better
Everyone loved my grandmother's stall. Many people bought the chilis and African eggplants, and many people came to taste the dishes she cooked.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
