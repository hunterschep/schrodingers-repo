President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
biro na Soto Chay ing-wen 'miwan Sexo' tmatok tonox sa Genzyominzok
On this day 22 years ago, the term "shanbao" (mountain people) in the Additional Articles of our Constitution was replaced with the proper name: "indigenous people." This correction not only did away with a discriminatory term, but also highlighted the status of indigenous peoples as Taiwan's "original owners." From this basis, today, we are taking another step forward. To all indigenous peoples of Taiwan: On behalf of the government, I express to you our deepest apology. For the four centuries of pain and mistreatment you have endured, I apologize to you on behalf of the government.

The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.

Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.

Indigenous peoples had their own languages. However, with Japanese rule aiming to assimilate and turn all into imperial subjects, and with the ROC government banning tribal languages after 1945, indigenous peoples' languages suffered great losses. Most Pingpu languages have disappeared. Successive governments have been negligent in the protection of indigenous cultures. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.

After the democratic transition, the country began to respond to the appeals of indigenous movements. The government made certain promises and efforts. Today, we have an Indigenous Peoples Basic Law that is quite advanced. However, government agencies have not given sufficient weight to this law. Our actions have not been fast enough, comprehensive enough or sound enough. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.

Taiwan is known as a culturally diverse society. But even today, indicators on health, education, economic livelihood, political participation and more still show gaps between indigenous and non- indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, stereotypes and even discrimination against indigenous peoples have not gone away. The government has not done enough, so indigenous peoples have suffered pain and frustration unknown to other ethnic peoples. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.

Our efforts have fallen short, and succeeding generations have been blind to this inadequacy. Because of this, your hardship has continued to this day. For this we are truly sorry. Today's apology is long overdue, but it is a beginning. I do not expect any one speech or phrase of apology to wipe away four centuries of pain and suffering by the indigenous peoples. But I do hope with all my heart that today's apology will set this country and all its people on the path towards reconciliation.

Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
anay mako' skahol sqo kinblayqan tonox smi' sa kay' na Genzyominzok kmayal sqo nyox ta' aylhoyan ssawni' qani. kay' na 'Tayal hya' ga ka "balay balay na zyoaw" ga, Balay sawn naha'. ro mtbalay hya' ga Sbalay sawn naha', niwan maha o twangan naha' sa "S" qo glaing na Balay qasa. balay balay sqo mtbalay qani ga, m'oboy qo awsa' kkyalan na sazing kay' qani hya'. qotox ozi qo kay' qani hya' ga, spzyang balay na mtbalay qani hya' ga, nano' si ki minkahol sa inlongan balay mosa' mssongos mkal sa zyoaw balay ga, thozyay mtbalay qo zyoaw.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
Gaga' na Genzyominzok hya' iy kya qo wal naha' inzhoqon saxa' lga, ato' na maki' inlongan naha' aki' mosa' Sbalay ga, motow paylhoyon na Mrhow qo msinzyoaw rrosa' qasa. paylhoyon naha' ga, iyat maha yaqo mosa' tmatok tonox, yaqo ppgwah sa inlongan naha' balay, ro kmayal sqo maha swa' maha qasa. tmasoq kmayal sa inlongan naha' lga, mplaw mnbow qwaw kya la, ro kwara' wayal ka kinzyaqih inlongan naha' lga, wayal balay ozi la. yani qo sawn naha' Sbalay.
I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.

Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.

Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
anay simo kmayal sqani, mosa' ps'rxon na Sotoxo' qo sawn maha " Genzyominzok Rekisi' segi'" sqo " Cwansing cng'i' Weyoenxwe'." mosa' mako' skahol sa lalo' na Mrhow Koka', mgppaylahoy na sqoliq, ro kwara' Rayxyo na qotox qotox zok msqon mosa' hmkangi' sqo Segi' na Rikisi', ro mosa' myan ptnaqon mkayal sa pptzyoaw sa awsa' na Koka' babaw niya' ozi.
I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.

Gaga' na ptzyowaw qani ga, mosa' yasa qo pinsqtoxan inlongan kwara' na Genzyominzok, mosa' thozyay payhtow sqo hngzyang inlongan na kwara' Genzyomin.
In addition, I will request that our Executive Yuan convene regularly the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law Promotion Committee, and use the Yuan's authority to coordinate and handle matters related to any consensus reached by the above-mentioned commission. These matters include the following: to retrieve historical memories, to promote indigenous self-government, to seek fair economic development, to ensure continuation of culture and education, to safeguard indigenous health, and to protect the rights of urban indigenous peoples, etc.

Where modern laws and indigenous traditional cultures are at odds, we will set up an Indigenous Legal Service Center with a high degree of cultural sensitivity, to reduce through institutional design the growing clashes between indigenous customs and modern laws.

I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.

I will also direct relevant agencies to present an investigative report on the decision-making process of nuclear waste storage on Orchid Island. Before finding a permanent solution for the nuclear waste, we will provide the Yami tribe appropriate compensation.

At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.

On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.

Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.

To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.

In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.

I call upon our entire society to come together and get to know our history, get to know our land, and get to know the cultures of our many ethnic peoples. Let us work towards reconciliation, a shared existence and shared prosperity, and a new future for Taiwan.

One man can't bear it, because it's too much.

Even children, too.

(The children) didn't know the names of the beasts.

What they ate was delicious. That's because they had never eaten things from the forest.

What they lived by was not the same as the present.

As for the life now, if with a little money, we would (do something).

Today, I have not finished talking, and there is still a little that should be talked about.

Sowing this thing should be at the time when summer is coming.
e tomovox hani ga asiki pakaavagan la ga.
Sowing and there are regulations of old men in the past, saying when the birds chirp, this is exactly the time to begin sowing.
tomovox ro kia ko pansapongan nko navakis songa' mha o maqowas ko qavahaniq mha o totot totot la maga yani vay la ko a anaringan i tomovox.
And when the birds chirp the again, should sow no matter what.

They also plowed bamboo forests in the past.
tiko vavoyqa songa' ga motox nha' panangon owi ro.
Burning and then sowing.
a silawm la ro tomovox la.
Before sowing, they would say to the elders, saying "Go and begin to pray a little."
tomovox ko la ga motox nha' sikaal sko navakis mha o halanay tikay i i pana'aring i somi'ato' gi.
If you don't pray, worms will eat his sprouts and sowing will be bad.
ini' mamo satowi ga motox motox i niqon na kowi ko a lovoq nia' ro motox aqih ko tinovoxan ma.
They say to an elder, "Go and perform the ceremony of first harvest," and then their crop would be good.

And next time when beginning to harvest.
ro' vavaw nia' la ga gi komloh deshihoo la ga pasay aring i komloh la ga.
Elderly women would come in groups and say, "Let's go and harvest, because the crop is good and its ear is good."

And elderly women indeed go harvesting.

Our crop is really good.
valayq vay ko tinoxan ta' ro.
We start harvesting and then we are all happy.

They thresh and after become white millet, say, "Let's thresh mochi."
soxoon nha' ro i matavavoax la ga sa ivowi la o taviqaw ta' la.
They would thresh and drink along the wine of the Atayal people, saying, "Let's make this wine of Atayal."
tomaviq ro motox nha' i galgan manovoaw motox i kavalay so owi so qowaw na itaal mha o tiko qowaw na itaal hani kavalayaw niam ro.
We must harvest, and thresh, and say, "Let's drink!" at that time.

The elders in the past, they knew farming in the mountains, because used to it and their were no fields of theirs. They only knew sowing (in the mountains).
a qamisowan songa' vaq i matawaw na a ragiax nha' gi talahani gi vali kia a a slaq nha' nanak ko tomovox ko vaqon nha'.
And when they are drunk, they would probably argue, saying "The work must be done this way, so that we can have food," which is what the elders agreed.
ro i ki'i movosinok la ga motox nha' i i paqahagan mha o asiki ginion ko matawwaw ga nano' o pakakiya ko naniqon ta' mha ko a pinkalan nko nanavakis.
Our times now is not the same.

In present times, there are grinding mills at the bottom of mountain.

will just go and buy rice, because it is fast.
motox asi osa' gomriax la gi yani a ini' kanga'.
The so-called praying ceremony means that they will delimit the boundaries of the land they are going to plow.
tiko salon mha somi'ato' hani ga motox nha' i i somi'ato' so papanangon nha'.
They go sowing and spill wine on the ground, saying "so that our crop will be good."
halan nha' i tomovox tomovox ro hi'an nha' so qowaw ko a raoq naki i valayq ko pintowawan ta' mha.
They do not miss God, because they say, "This God decides everything of ours."

When they are going to put the crops into the barn, they will eat the first portion.

The rest of their eating, they will put it in the barn.

When they thresh rice, they go to take by bundles one after another, and they thresh with a pestle.

Go and see the trap they set up.

When they go and perform the land delineation ceremony, they walk on foot on the road to their dry land.
mosa' somi'ato' owi ga motox homakay so raniq homakay na kokoy mosa' i sko mamayah nha' ro.
The sisiliq bird comes chirping. It goes down from high above. This is good.
onial ko sisiliq siik ma i tagi makaraya' ro aroa tagi hogal ga nano' o valayq mha ro.
chirps at the end of the road, and flies to the top.
kasiyok maki i yaho' raniq ro siik ma ro aroa tigi makaraya' ga.
They think, "If do not see the bird, our walking wwouild be bad, and crop would be bad"

Since I was a child, when I knew things, when I studied in my childhood.

When I was eight years old, my father brought me to hunt in the mountain.

I followed the old people, and let me see...I saw boarss.

Then, they chased the hog, caught it, and stabbed it.
ro vahagon nha' ro qalowapon nha' ro havon nha' la.
When we carried the pig to the river, we burned the fur.
sipanga' nha' ro gawng la ga as sayokan mian la.
Then, finishing eating, again we went to one mountain- a hunting house... to a hunting house.
ro taqaro' sami maniq ga mosa' sami lawwi so qotox ragiyax ro mosa' i mosa' sami tatak la maki sami tatak la ro.
Well, our elders- our father, grandfather, and uncles, hid in the bush to look for flying squirrels.
tiko nanabakis miyan ga yava' miyan yotas miyan ro' mama' miyan mosa' qombowang so yapit la mosa' qombowang so yapit la ro.
For those who shoot well, they will bring two flying squirrels.
e kiya ko vaq s i mro' ga niya maras so saying ko sinbo' nha' ka yapit.
For those who don't shoot well or didn't shoot anything, they came back to the hunting house bare-handed.
s kiya ko ini' qavaq ga ini' sbo' ga anya asi pqabaqava' ro mowah tatak.
Then, we chatted with each other and drank wine until the middle of the night; and then we slept.
ro m mapatisan ro manovoag so qowaw la ro taihok i ska' mahngan la ga maqilaap la.
After we all woke up, we separated because we went hunting again for flying squirrels, squirrels, and pheasants.
ro mtotol sami kahavaw la ga magagaang sami gi mosa' i qomavowang lawwi so e yapit vahot hoN tikoxi'.
Then arriving the hunting house, they put their trophies together; many trophies put together seemed to be many strange beasts.

We were all glad and we said that we were lucky.

The origin of our ancestors in the past was from the Papak Mountain, and those who were originally here in Taiwan had all been aggregated there.
tiko gingamilan ta' ka navakis songa' ga minkahol kia papak ro minsa'a'oto' ta' kia kahavag ka ka' a'iani roni i taiwan.
Suddenly, a typhoon came, and after that the Papak mountain collapsed.
toliq ro wahan na vayho la wahan na vayho ro silohey ko papak ro.
Those who came downward to Miaoli here are called the Atayal people. Since we are separated by the mountains from each other, unfortunately, the accents of our languages do not resemble each other.
tiko movaq roni i vari hani ga taiyazo salon ko minoka movaq vari ga aqih gi qaison ragiax la ga ini' paska' ko hanaang na ka kai' la gi.
There are those who are (whose language is) called Matu'au, and there are those who are (whose language is) called Matu'uwal.
kia ko san mha mato'ao kia ko san mha mato'owal.
As for us, the people of Mavatu'an here, since we had come, there really wasn't any food.
ro' tiko sami ka mavato'an hani hiya' ga na'aring sami i kia mowah ro okas vay naniqon.
We had no choice but stay together with the beasts because there were no guns in the past, and no gun powder either.
asi paglo kina qasino gi kia okas a patos songa' gi vali kia a qavoli' owi.
What we brought were really only the hunting knives.

Our lives in the past were the same as those of the beasts.
iniwan na qasino kinqiyanox mian songa' i.
We went downhill and came to the foot of the Papak Mountain.
ro maqahqowaw sami ro mowah sami i yaho na papak la ro.
The Atayal people found some rice seeds.
ro lomoag tikay so gaghap na na pati' la ko itaal.
That's probably God's gift, so that we can live on in that way.

The men went hunting.

There was no salt in the past.

What do we have as salt in the past?
nanoan ko timo' songa' pisa.
As they came down hill a little more, they arrived at Mavatu'an.
ro maqaq mowah lawwi maqahqowaw lawwi ro poah mha vay i mavato'an la.
And the Japanese came. Were the Japanese here over sixty years?
ro mowah ko gipon la yani ko maymal so kaal ro masiya matopagal so kaal masiyaw laroa? ko gipon hani ro.
They probably saw there were people making smoke in the mountains, and said "Go take them!" "Let's teach them how to work!" said the Japanese.
ki'i nia' talan ro kia soqoliq ka sogohiloq i ragiax ro to'on nia' ko gipon mha hali magan ro pasivaqay ta' so paptawwaw mha ko gipon ro.
Then, they taught us the way of working.

We dug some fields.
komaay sami so slaq la.
This is just our lives during our stay in Mavatu'an in the past.

we planted taros and planted beans. That's what we depended on when we lived.

Seen in this way, it is unfortunate that I did not follow the orders and the words of the elders in the past.
gini'on taal ga aqih gi qaat koing i sinlanga'an sinvilan kai' nko navakis songa' ga.
There was no sickness in the past.

One would not find terrible things, and could just live like the beasts.

I'll describe how we started from Mavatu'an and arrived at Savawqil here, and the names of the places which we passed through as we travelled.

Up toward Mavatu'an is Gawng Kating.

Toward the side of Mavatu'an, but down from Gawng Kating is Sayta' Siri.
tigi roni nia' ga miyaho nia' lawwi ga miyaho nia' lawwi ga sayta' siri.
Downward from Sayta' Siri would be Takmaya'an.
s say mayaho' nia' la ga takmaya'an.
Coming further toward us from Takmaya'an, one would reach Paqalapaw.
mowah la ga paqalapaw.
Down from Paqalapaw would be Tinapa'an.
miyaho nia' la ga tinapa'an.
Afterwards one would arrive at Sugu'ivu', and much downward from Sugu'ivu' would be what is called Savawqil, which is the place we are at right here now.

Those ruling us have changed now.

It's not that the imperialist Japanese treated us badly when ruling us.

The Chinese ruled us well.

They are doing research on the origin of the Atayal people.

They didn't say "You aborigines, live by yourself!" We are really thankful.

Let's just obey God, who's going to take care of us.

Before, not like now, women like us used to live in the house.

And men go to the mountains to lay traps with ropes.

And when seeing there is no rice, we pound rice.

We prepare to cook some dishes.

Seeing so many animals they shot like muntjac and boar, women are so happy.

After drinking the wine, they are happy, and they distribute the game they got.

They chat and drink wine.

And sometimes, the two...

After finishing (distributing the game), they chat with each other.

That is all. What else?

That is all. What else?

When I was a little child, my father brought me, and went to the mountain, and set
olaqi kong songa' ro rason koing ni yava' mo mosa' i ragiyax mosa' i somko' so trap.
And then, three or four days later, we went to see, and it was taking place that a hog was hung.
toliq ro makato ro makaspat ga halan mian i mitaal hani vay taroyqon ko qotox ko vaowak.
We said that we came stabbing.
havaw ta' maha sami.
He had already stabbed the hog into its throat.

He asked me to carry it on the back, but I just couldn't.
panga nia' sipapanga' nia koing ro ini' mo paproyqi.
We came back, and we were at the hunting hut. All his fellow companions threw to the place for rest (to show off).
moah sami ro maki sami kaykian havag ko vais nia' pakati' nia' soko qaqalapan naha.
Wow, indeed you hung something big big, they said.
apao ako so ow taroiqon la ko ra howal san naha ko.
All his fellow companions were glad.

After burning off the hair of the hog, they cut it.
naqaron somayok haovingon naha'.
The meat was intended to be taken to the children at home.
tiko hi ga siaras i soko olaqi imowag.
The internal organs were cooked in the mountains.
tiko giyos la ga tahkon kiya i ragiyax la ro.
We ate and then we drank the liquor, and the elders were so happy that they began to sing because they were really happy.
maniq sami so mami' la ro manovowag so qowaw ro maymaw pana'is ko nanavakis gi paqason naha' la.
We came back and chatted with each other at home, discussing when would be the next visit.

settled on the date and would check the trap again.
somko so riax so aosa' naha' mitaal lawwi.
And then, seven days later, they went to check the trap again.
toliq ro maka mapito' ro halan naha' mitaal lawwi.
We went there again, and I followed Father there again.
mosa' sami lawwi ro gomro kong lawwi i yava' mo.
We arrived there (the hunting area), and we had something hung at a new place, and it was one muntjac.
tayhok sami kiya qaat yani la ko tinroyqan taroyqon nia la hani tinroweq so para'.
We took away the muntjac.

We beat (the munjtac) and we took it away.
totingon niam ro alon niam.
What we hunted was only one muntjac.
ro qotox sovalay ko para' miam.
And then, they burned its hair just like when they went hunting.
toliq ro sayokan naha' nano' asi nako manaaling mosa' ka.
They drank for this.
sinovowag naha' ro.
They were happy at heart.
maqas ko inlongan naha'.
The reason is that, in the past, the elders were like this. If they were happy at heart, they drank a little liquor. After that, would keep singing and sleep until the next day. We did not part until the following day.
gi mowani ko navakis songa' i maqas inloangan ga ga manovowag tikay so qowaw ro manaqro' manovowag la ga mapanaqowas la panaqowas la ro kinsasan maqilap la ro kinsasan nia' la ga sogagay sami la ro.
We went searching, and I asked: "Why was there no rice?"

In the past the life of the elderly were really nice.

Though they had no gains, they were still happy. At their heart, they did not think that they had things to worry about.

If the elders had things to eat, they were happy. It was not like this era when many things demand money.

There are many places where money can be spent.

The burden of life is heavy.
savak maqiyanox i.
I compare the past era with the present, and I think that the elderly had life a little better in the past, because their life was simple.
sipanaspong mo kinqyanox nako citay songa' kinko hani ga valayq tiqay ko kinqayanox nako navakis songa' hiya' bijiawtancon ko kinqiyanox nako navakis songa' ro.
I felt at heart that we should not forget the rule of the elderly.
nano' asigi ini' ta' ongiyi ko gaga' nako nanavakis songa' maha ko inlongan mo.
The boy's father does not take the boy (when going to propose).
ko olaqi' na tama yava' nko olaqi' na tamalong ini' rasi ko olaqi' mi.
The elders used to say that it is customary to bring preserved meat and rice cake and one would hang them on the tree in case the dog would eat them.
loqingon s i motox maras tinmami'an maras so tinnaviq ro siqowi' i qowi'ani i vavawiq ki gi naniqon na xowil motox maha ko navakis songa'.
They hang the things on the tree and go to talk about the marriage.
siqowi' nha' vavawiq kahoniq ro mosa' ro mosa' i tomayi'.
They discuss about the marriage in a difficult, elegant way.
tomayi' ro mayayihong makaal.
If they don't agree, they would bring the food back and eat them on the way home.
ini' siwaal la ga nawson lawwi ko naniqon niqon raniq ro mowah imowag.
If the mother does not agree, they would hide the child and let the father decide.
mahanano' ga ini' siwaal ko yaya' ga loqingon nha ko olaqi' ro yako yava' ko paspongon nha mi.
the father drinks the wine, if the mother doesn't like it, she would not participate in the drinking because women did not dare to argue against their husbands before.
nano' manavowag ko yava' mahanano' ga i qaat kisiliq nko yaya' ga motox i arowa magiyai gi ini' vay kas'ang so tamalong ko kanayril songa' kaison naha ko tamalong.
Then they will come to send gifts and decide on the date.
mosa' somato' kavahniq ko yani han ro mowah la ro somko' so riax.
When deciding on the date, we would not refer to the exact date because the Atayal people didn't have calendars before.
somko' so riax ro mos makapiya' maha ini' kosa' maha ciyoecihao gi vali kia' a viro nko' itaal songa'.
We could only measure the time between going to sleep and waking up as a day and counted days in this way.
asi naha' i sapongi nko riax maqilaap ro tihoway ga qotox so riax maha ko lalapgan naha' songa' ro.
After the proposal, the girl would then know a bit about the marriage.
mosa' tomayi' ro ga vaqon hayhay nko olaqi' na kanayril la.
The boy and the girl could not get close to each other because we were very conservative in the past.
ga' vali maksawbih ko 'olaqi' na tamalong kinko olaqi' na tama na kanayril gi henpaosho vay so songa' vay mi.
They would decide on the date of proposal after the harvest.
i sko'on naha' ko kai' maha o sko'aw ta' sko komiloh la ga a ta' masina so kai la.
The proposal cannot be postponed for too long because the harvested rice would then be all eaten up.
mosa' masina' so kai' skoon ta' kanowan maha ini' kaingaso ko yani la gi gi yako pati' kinloh naha' gi ingaso rarima' naha pataqron la ga.
(If there is no more food), they cannot go there to marry the child.
lap paka'okas lawwi a 'a'agal naha' so olaqi' la.
Their discussion of marriage sometimes takes a week, sometimes ten days.
o makorisa ga soqonaw ta' maha ko pinkalan naha' mahanano ga qotox pinhangiqan mahanano ga makamagalpo.
During these years, it is common for the boy to go (to the girl's house) help with household.
zhege tiko ri'ax yani ga motox mosa' i romag so waw ko olaqi' tamalong.
When their marriage has been decided, they can the live together when the day of their wedding has come.
ro sko'on nha' ko' kai' la i ptari' masina' so kai' la ga soqonon nha' la taihok ko ri'ax ka soqonon nha' la ga s masoqon la ro.
We would again follow our girl to go to drink at the boy's house.
halay ta' gomlo tikay lawwi ko olaqi' ta' na kanayril lawwi maha mowah manavoag lawwi sko olaqi' na tamalong ro.
Finally, the boy and the girl get married.
manaqilang i masoqon la ko olaqi' na tamalong kinko olaqi' na kanayril.
That's it.

I will tell you our life of Matu'uwal.

I don't know our origin, but I've heard about it from our ancestors.
ro tiko inkaholan ga ini' baqi asikina ga pinogan sko kai' nko nakaotas miyan ka arowa masisoro i arowa i babaw na kaal la.
When we lived in Papak, there were not manu people because we even don't know where we came from.
maki sami papak songa' ga ini' sami kahabag gi nano' gi itaal sami ga ki sami minokahol ino' ga ini' baqi.
This is what I am saying.
ro nano' o yani ko a niyan mo i sikaal.
During the life under Japanese occupation, the water increased and the flood engulfed the land.
kinqiyanox nko gipon ka niyal i a mararaya sko raoq ko wasilong ga.
Not knowing how, the gods keep them living there.
ki'i mahanano ko kinqiyanox miyan ka niya sami lahowon na kamisama' rowa.
When the flood went away, perhaps because (the gods think) it is enough, the water dried and we came to Mabatuan.
arowa la ko wasilong la gi arowa mayayaho la ko wasilong la gi e ki'i yani ko ska' nia la ro arowa i mana'aping la ko wasilong la ro mowah sami la i mabatoan hani la.
When we came to Mabatuan, there was no food.
mowah sami mabatoan ro okas ko niqon niyam la ga.
There is no food, so our forefathers thought that we can sow and grow some food.
naniqon niyam la ga niyan lomanglong ko na sami ka nabakis maha o kiya ta' tmoboh tikay so naniqon.
We go to look for seeds and find seeds like seeds of dry rice.
nano' o mosa' sami i komiyom sko gaghap ro lomowag sami sko gaghap gaghap na pati' aping.
After the rice bear seeds, we harvest and pound the rice with mortars.
ro i makaboway la ga yani ko a kalhon miyan soxo'on miyan na lohiyong.
Because there was mortar before, we have to make it by ourselves.
gi kiya ko lohiyong songa' ka kinbalay miyan nanak la ro.
There was no electricity, and the forefathers could not think of other ways but using hands to pound the rice.
soxo'on miyan kiya gi bali kiya a tingki bali kiya a a nano' nanak bay ko qahba' bay ko asi langlong gi ini' i qabaq so inlalongan ko nabakis.
And we cooked, and that is how we live our lives.
nano' o pahapoyon miyan pahapoyon miyan la ro yani ko sikaqiyanox miyan.
Afterwards, we live in Mabatuan.
ro tiko hani la ga niyan sami i maki sami mabatoan songa' ga.
When the Japanese ruled Taiwan, they said that if we move downward, they would teach us how to farm.
komaal ko gipon songa' maha o gi tiko gipon songa' ga minlahang tikay ko taiwan ro tiko gipon ga komaal maha owah bay hogal la ro psibaqay simo so paptaowaw la maha.
We did move downward here, and the place we're staying now is called Sabawqil.
nano' mowah sami sobalay tagironi la gi tiko kakian miyan hani ga sabawqil salon.
As for why it is called Mabatuan, it's because the place we came from, our origin, was the land called Mabatuan.
ro mabatoan san gi sowa' salon mabatoan ga inkaholan miyan sko inkaholan miyan sko inkaholan miyan i mabatoan mabatoan salon ko raoq ka yani.
Then we come to Tapin.
ro mowah sami roni i i tapin hani.
And we really have nothing to eat.
ro okas bay ko a naniqon miyan.
The Japanese say, "we will teach you farming so that you know how to farm your own land."
komaal ko gipon maha o psibaqay simo so a kinqiyanox naki simo baq ma nano' o kaiho nanak so slaq ma.
The pieces of flat land down below.
nano' tiko slaq ka nangi' na e piang piang tikay hogal hasa ga.
I truly think our lives in the place called Mabatuan is not really good.
a e swoi yani ko niya mo longolongon sko hani ro ato' na aqih bay ko kinqiyanox miyan ka salon maha o mabatoan.
Actually, such saying may be right; anyway, I am not quite sure.
shish i ye ciangde potsoo haish zenmeyang wome ye wowo ye posiaode la.
Old people like me cannot comment on the thoughts of those who take care of us (the government).
yinwe kowing ka nabakis la ga ini' mo baqi i panaspong ko inlolongan nko malahang ita'.
So I say our lives in Mabatuan are relly not good.
nano' yani ko niya kong maha o sami ka itaal ka niya' i mabatoan na hani aqih bay kinqiyanox miyan.
Luckily, the government is teaching us how to live.
e olong yako tawki' ka niya i e pasibaq so kai' sami maha o.
The government says that you have to work hard and grow all kinds of produce like fruits and corn. You have to work or you will starve to die.
a kalawkah mataowaw ro pomowa' so ananano' shoeikoo la haiyo nake yomi sheme nochanpin ga i a nimenyaoco gi nimen meyo co ga nimen hoei osh maha ko malahang ita' ro.
We don't know much probably because we Atayal live with wild animals.
e bali i itaal sami okas bay ko baqon miyan gi ki'i songa' hiya' ga ma'imag sami na ss sami sko qasino rowa.
We didn't know each other before, but now you teach us your mother tongue so we know and understand each other now.

I've been thinking that our lives in the beginning are really not good.

Depends on the situation, but it takes at least three to five months or even longer.

The longer the rice is stored, the more it dissolves, the more fluid the sake becomes, and the better the flavor. Let time brew the wine! Wait patiently
