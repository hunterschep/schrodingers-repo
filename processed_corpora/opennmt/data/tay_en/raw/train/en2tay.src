President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
On this day 22 years ago, the term "shanbao" (mountain people) in the Additional Articles of our Constitution was replaced with the proper name: "indigenous people." This correction not only did away with a discriminatory term, but also highlighted the status of indigenous peoples as Taiwan's "original owners." From this basis, today, we are taking another step forward. To all indigenous peoples of Taiwan: On behalf of the government, I express to you our deepest apology. For the four centuries of pain and mistreatment you have endured, I apologize to you on behalf of the government.
The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Indigenous peoples had their own languages. However, with Japanese rule aiming to assimilate and turn all into imperial subjects, and with the ROC government banning tribal languages after 1945, indigenous peoples' languages suffered great losses. Most Pingpu languages have disappeared. Successive governments have been negligent in the protection of indigenous cultures. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
After the democratic transition, the country began to respond to the appeals of indigenous movements. The government made certain promises and efforts. Today, we have an Indigenous Peoples Basic Law that is quite advanced. However, government agencies have not given sufficient weight to this law. Our actions have not been fast enough, comprehensive enough or sound enough. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Taiwan is known as a culturally diverse society. But even today, indicators on health, education, economic livelihood, political participation and more still show gaps between indigenous and non- indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, stereotypes and even discrimination against indigenous peoples have not gone away. The government has not done enough, so indigenous peoples have suffered pain and frustration unknown to other ethnic peoples. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Our efforts have fallen short, and succeeding generations have been blind to this inadequacy. Because of this, your hardship has continued to this day. For this we are truly sorry. Today's apology is long overdue, but it is a beginning. I do not expect any one speech or phrase of apology to wipe away four centuries of pain and suffering by the indigenous peoples. But I do hope with all my heart that today's apology will set this country and all its people on the path towards reconciliation.
Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.
Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.
In addition, I will request that our Executive Yuan convene regularly the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law Promotion Committee, and use the Yuan's authority to coordinate and handle matters related to any consensus reached by the above-mentioned commission. These matters include the following: to retrieve historical memories, to promote indigenous self-government, to seek fair economic development, to ensure continuation of culture and education, to safeguard indigenous health, and to protect the rights of urban indigenous peoples, etc.
Where modern laws and indigenous traditional cultures are at odds, we will set up an Indigenous Legal Service Center with a high degree of cultural sensitivity, to reduce through institutional design the growing clashes between indigenous customs and modern laws.
I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.
I will also direct relevant agencies to present an investigative report on the decision-making process of nuclear waste storage on Orchid Island. Before finding a permanent solution for the nuclear waste, we will provide the Yami tribe appropriate compensation.
At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.
On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.
Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.
To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.
I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.
In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.
I call upon our entire society to come together and get to know our history, get to know our land, and get to know the cultures of our many ethnic peoples. Let us work towards reconciliation, a shared existence and shared prosperity, and a new future for Taiwan.
I call upon all citizens to seize the opportunities offered by this day - to join together, work hard, and build a country of justice, a country of true diversity and equality.
Thank you all
finish digging out the ginger, and when the amount is known to be enough for planting, we have them cut.
After they are cut, they're taken to be planted.
After we plant them, we cut the grass around the crops, plums and oranges.
And, after we finish our work, when seeing grass growing around our ginger, we'll go to spray insecticide and add fertilizer.
Just like this April, would gather bamboo shoots, and go to cut grass. And after cutting the grass, see there are bamboo shoots, we'll start to gather them.
My name is Tawyu Yukeh.
(My father is) Yukeh na Talit.
My mother is Lauway na Vawnay.
Vawnay Paliay.
When I was a child, I was born here in the tribe of Mavatu'an.
My mother took care of all of us siblings.
My mother knows how to weave.
It was a burden for her to take care of us sibilings and her health had been bad until my mother passed away.
Today I am here by myself.
Even though we are living, among all the siblings, there are only three living here.
God made me stay.
My mother used to teach me a little about how to make the clothes of the indigenous people, but I didn't manage to learn it because I did not work hard in studying.
I live in the house in the mountain by myself.
But I am healthy. I can still work.
Thank God.
Take Kagaw Nawkeh for example, she is really good at weaving and selecting the wool color for making clothing of the indigenous people.
And our chief is Kainu na Hawving.
Our chief really loves what we call our tribe.
Even when sick, everyone works very hard, because we must take care of our children.
Therefore, we should even though our body would get tired.
We are still doing our work here in the mountains.
Thank the people from this university for coming to ask about our language.
I have the time to come speak about this today.
Today right here, no matter what, if I didn't express myself clearly, then just let it be, because I am not knowledgeable and not educated.
I didn't go to school, and my father passed away when I was a child.
It's been a burden for my mother to have taken care.
I am now living alone in this mountain.
All my children are working in the city.
I am not knowledgeable.
Everyone work hard to take care of their grandchildren.
The women in Mavatu'an here work extremely hard to take care of the grandchildren.
Thank you all.
These are just what I have to say.
I am Kainu', son of Hawvin, son of Vaw.
In the past, I went to shoot bears.
In the past, I followed to the forest to shoot boars all the time.
I went, because there were no books of us in the past.
When I went to the mountain, I would just go on foot.
I went down from a.
didn't know the road traveled.
If did not know the road traveled, needed to chop down the trees, so that you would know the road traveled.
This way you wouldn't get lost.
If you get lost, you don't know where you will appear.
You wouldn't be found by people who go for a search.
I went to shoot polatouches or boars in the past.
There would really be many beasts in the past, because the forest was widespread.
There was everything.
Old men would go shooting and take back.
They went shooting, and would bear on their back home.
They will relieve his family.
That's because they have little to eat in the past.
There was no farming field for them to farm.
They could only eat beasts because there was no harvest of rice.
They ate that beast.
If after shooting, they bring back to house.
Women were waiting in the house.
If they shot much, they would tell the kids, "Let's go to bring back."
One man can't bear it, because it's too much.
They led the youngster, saying "Let's go bring back the prey I hunted'.
Because there was too much to bring back, brought the youngsters.
They bore it on back and brought it home.
They brought it back home and everyone saw them.
The family were happy.
prepared wine for drinking.
After they drank wine, they got happy.
They ate, and cooked and ate the thing they brought back.
Even children, too.
(The children) didn't know the names of the beasts.
What they ate was delicious. That's because they had never eaten things from the forest.
What they lived by was not the same as the present.
As for the life now, if with a little money, we would (do something).
I will go to buy.
Money is strong now.
They go to buy rice and food back, and eat in the house.
The life is the same as in the past.
Today, I have not finished talking, and there is still a little that should be talked about.
Sowing this thing should be at the time when summer is coming.
Sowing and there are regulations of old men in the past, saying when the birds chirp, this is exactly the time to begin sowing.
And when the birds chirp the again, should sow no matter what.
They also plowed bamboo forests in the past.
Burning and then sowing.
Before sowing, they would say to the elders, saying "Go and begin to pray a little."
If you don't pray, worms will eat his sprouts and sowing will be bad.
They say to an elder, "Go and perform the ceremony of first harvest," and then their crop would be good.
And next time when beginning to harvest.
Elderly women would come in groups and say, "Let's go and harvest, because the crop is good and its ear is good."
And elderly women indeed go harvesting.
Our crop is really good.
We start harvesting and then we are all happy.
They thresh and after become white millet, say, "Let's thresh mochi."
They would thresh and drink along the wine of the Atayal people, saying, "Let's make this wine of Atayal."
We must harvest, and thresh, and say, "Let's drink!" at that time.
The elders in the past, they knew farming in the mountains, because used to it and their were no fields of theirs. They only knew sowing (in the mountains).
And when they are drunk, they would probably argue, saying "The work must be done this way, so that we can have food," which is what the elders agreed.
Our times now is not the same.
In present times, there are grinding mills at the bottom of mountain.
will just go and buy rice, because it is fast.
The so-called praying ceremony means that they will delimit the boundaries of the land they are going to plow.
They go sowing and spill wine on the ground, saying "so that our crop will be good."
They do not miss God, because they say, "This God decides everything of ours."
When they are going to put the crops into the barn, they will eat the first portion.
The rest of their eating, they will put it in the barn.
When they thresh rice, they go to take by bundles one after another, and they thresh with a pestle.
Go and see the trap they set up.
When they go and perform the land delineation ceremony, they walk on foot on the road to their dry land.
The sisiliq bird comes chirping. It goes down from high above. This is good.
chirps at the end of the road, and flies to the top.
They think, "If do not see the bird, our walking wwouild be bad, and crop would be bad"
Since I was a child, when I knew things, when I studied in my childhood.
When I was eight years old, my father brought me to hunt in the mountain.
I followed the old people, and let me see...I saw boarss.
Then, they chased the hog, caught it, and stabbed it.
When we carried the pig to the river, we burned the fur.
Then, finishing eating, again we went to one mountain- a hunting house... to a hunting house.
Well, our elders- our father, grandfather, and uncles, hid in the bush to look for flying squirrels.
For those who shoot well, they will bring two flying squirrels.
For those who don't shoot well or didn't shoot anything, they came back to the hunting house bare-handed.
Then, we chatted with each other and drank wine until the middle of the night; and then we slept.
After we all woke up, we separated because we went hunting again for flying squirrels, squirrels, and pheasants.
Then arriving the hunting house, they put their trophies together; many trophies put together seemed to be many strange beasts.
We were all glad and we said that we were lucky.
The origin of our ancestors in the past was from the Papak Mountain, and those who were originally here in Taiwan had all been aggregated there.
Suddenly, a typhoon came, and after that the Papak mountain collapsed.
Those who came downward to Miaoli here are called the Atayal people. Since we are separated by the mountains from each other, unfortunately, the accents of our languages do not resemble each other.
There are those who are (whose language is) called Matu'au, and there are those who are (whose language is) called Matu'uwal.
As for us, the people of Mavatu'an here, since we had come, there really wasn't any food.
We had no choice but stay together with the beasts because there were no guns in the past, and no gun powder either.
What we brought were really only the hunting knives.
Our lives in the past were the same as those of the beasts.
We went downhill and came to the foot of the Papak Mountain.
The Atayal people found some rice seeds.
That's probably God's gift, so that we can live on in that way.
The men went hunting.
There was no salt in the past.
What do we have as salt in the past?
As they came down hill a little more, they arrived at Mavatu'an.
And the Japanese came. Were the Japanese here over sixty years?
They probably saw there were people making smoke in the mountains, and said "Go take them!" "Let's teach them how to work!" said the Japanese.
Then, they taught us the way of working.
We dug some fields.
This is just our lives during our stay in Mavatu'an in the past.
we planted taros and planted beans. That's what we depended on when we lived.
Seen in this way, it is unfortunate that I did not follow the orders and the words of the elders in the past.
There was no sickness in the past.
One would not find terrible things, and could just live like the beasts.
I'll describe how we started from Mavatu'an and arrived at Savawqil here, and the names of the places which we passed through as we travelled.
Up toward Mavatu'an is Gawng Kating.
Toward the side of Mavatu'an, but down from Gawng Kating is Sayta' Siri.
Downward from Sayta' Siri would be Takmaya'an.
Coming further toward us from Takmaya'an, one would reach Paqalapaw.
Down from Paqalapaw would be Tinapa'an.
Afterwards one would arrive at Sugu'ivu', and much downward from Sugu'ivu' would be what is called Savawqil, which is the place we are at right here now.
Those ruling us have changed now.
Those ruling us have been replaced by the Chinese.
It's not that the imperialist Japanese treated us badly when ruling us.
The Chinese ruled us well.
Thank those who are ruling us here.
They are doing research on the origin of the Atayal people.
They didn't say "You aborigines, live by yourself!" We are really thankful.
Let's just obey God, who's going to take care of us.
Thank you all.
Before, not like now, women like us used to live in the house.
will cook and take care of the child.
And men go to the mountains to lay traps with ropes.
And when seeing there is no rice, we pound rice.
And they come back.
forgot.
We prepare to cook some dishes.
Seeing so many animals they shot like muntjac and boar, women are so happy.
After drinking the wine, they are happy, and they distribute the game they got.
They chat and drink wine.
And sometimes, the two...
After finishing (distributing the game), they chat with each other.
That is all. What else?
That is all. What else?
When I was a little child, my father brought me, and went to the mountain, and set
And then, three or four days later, we went to see, and it was taking place that a hog was hung.
We said that we came stabbing.
He had already stabbed the hog into its throat.
He asked me to carry it on the back, but I just couldn't.
We came back, and we were at the hunting hut. All his fellow companions threw to the place for rest (to show off).
Wow, indeed you hung something big big, they said.
All his fellow companions were glad.
After burning off the hair of the hog, they cut it.
The meat was intended to be taken to the children at home.
The internal organs were cooked in the mountains.
We ate and then we drank the liquor, and the elders were so happy that they began to sing because they were really happy.
We came back and chatted with each other at home, discussing when would be the next visit.
settled on the date and would check the trap again.
And then, seven days later, they went to check the trap again.
We went there again, and I followed Father there again.
We arrived there (the hunting area), and we had something hung at a new place, and it was one muntjac.
We took away the muntjac.
We beat (the munjtac) and we took it away.
What we hunted was only one muntjac.
And then, they burned its hair just like when they went hunting.
They drank for this.
They were happy at heart.
The reason is that, in the past, the elders were like this. If they were happy at heart, they drank a little liquor. After that, would keep singing and sleep until the next day. We did not part until the following day.
We went searching, and I asked: "Why was there no rice?"
In the past the life of the elderly were really nice.
Though they had no gains, they were still happy. At their heart, they did not think that they had things to worry about.
If the elders had things to eat, they were happy. It was not like this era when many things demand money.
There are many places where money can be spent.
The burden of life is heavy.
I compare the past era with the present, and I think that the elderly had life a little better in the past, because their life was simple.
I felt at heart that we should not forget the rule of the elderly.
The boy's father does not take the boy (when going to propose).
The elders used to say that it is customary to bring preserved meat and rice cake and one would hang them on the tree in case the dog would eat them.
They hang the things on the tree and go to talk about the marriage.
They discuss about the marriage in a difficult, elegant way.
If they don't agree, they would bring the food back and eat them on the way home.
If the mother does not agree, they would hide the child and let the father decide.
the father drinks the wine, if the mother doesn't like it, she would not participate in the drinking because women did not dare to argue against their husbands before.
Then they will come to send gifts and decide on the date.
When deciding on the date, we would not refer to the exact date because the Atayal people didn't have calendars before.
We could only measure the time between going to sleep and waking up as a day and counted days in this way.
After the proposal, the girl would then know a bit about the marriage.
The boy and the girl could not get close to each other because we were very conservative in the past.
They would decide on the date of proposal after the harvest.
The proposal cannot be postponed for too long because the harvested rice would then be all eaten up.
(If there is no more food), they cannot go there to marry the child.
Their discussion of marriage sometimes takes a week, sometimes ten days.
During these years, it is common for the boy to go (to the girl's house) help with household.
When their marriage has been decided, they can the live together when the day of their wedding has come.
We would again follow our girl to go to drink at the boy's house.
Finally, the boy and the girl get married.
That's it.
And my father is Yukeh Naupas.
My mother is Laway Naupas.
My grandfather is Yupas na Talaw.
And there were still elderly people - Yupas Talaw, Talaw na Kuwi', and Kuwi' Qangqang.
My name is Kagaw, Kagaw nawkeh.
My mother is Laway Naupas.
We would go working, and my father and mother would bring us to work.
We had not studied by that time.
And we went to work.
The work was to do sowing in the dry land. did sowing and reaping.
And while we were having a rest, an elderly woman taught us how to weave.
woman taught me about it, and then I knew how.
Yes, started.
I became more and more adept.
I learned all of the weaving skills, including very difficult ones.
Yes. Yes. went to work and. We did the sowing and then finished it.
In the past, the elderly rested at home, and now we the elder ones rested at home before.
Men went hunting, and looked for food.
money. We had no money and men went to look for food in the mountains.
Women did the weaving at home.
They were really fireweeds in the mountains.
We plucked fireweeds and so we had some vegetable and seeds.
We sowed some of the seeds on the dry land, and what grew there was for eating.
We did not use oil either.
We used no oil.
We cooked without oil. In the past, our food could only be cooked with water.
And we weren't able to go to the lower ground because we had no money to go to the lower ground.
After a long time, and we were able to go down to the lower ground.
went there. We had money. We went to work and earned some money.
After having some money, we went to the lower ground to buy some food.
We went to buy food, and we did so on foot. There was no car before.
walked to Pakaragiyax.
I would bring the mealbox with me.
I went to Samkayk to have fermented soybean curd.
In the past it took one day to walk to Pakaragiyax.
walked there, because there was no car before.
It was unlike now that it takes you just a little time to go back and forth.
The life before was not good.
There was no money.
The old men had no money before.
Yes.
Father and Mother brought us to work.
It was just sowing.
It was just sowing and rice plants.
sowed and grew the Chinese silk plants.
The Chinese silk plants.
had it peeled off there and sold the Chinese silk plants.
There was just buying. There was selling Chinese silk plants and dry Chinese silk plants.
We had money because there was a lot of Chinese silk plants.
We grew Chinese silk plants just. We went to sell and we had money.
In the very beginning, there was nothing that we grew for sale.
They were dried by sunshine and tied together
A lot of them were dried and tied together.
made threads.

made threads and cooked (for later dying).
had cooked, exposed to the sun, and dried.
immersed the things to be mixed.
A lot of (dying ingredients). There must be things (dying ingredients) to be mixed.

Then it turned black.
And Dioscorea Matsudae. Dioscorea Matsudae. We had them immersed with Dioscorea Matsudae and there were grasses to make them greeen.

coil the threads and weave.
And there is chosen stuff
If the chosen colors look good, others will say that you are good at weaving.
Well, no, no.
Its meaning is like that.
No one says that there must be certain ways of pattern weaving.
Sometimes there must be some pattern for my chosen colors.
Some say that have to follow a pattern in weaving, but it is not so.
I will tell you our life of Matu'uwal.
I don't know our origin, but I've heard about it from our ancestors.
When we lived in Papak, there were not manu people because we even don't know where we came from.
This is what I am saying.
During the life under Japanese occupation, the water increased and the flood engulfed the land.
Not knowing how, the gods keep them living there.
When the flood went away, perhaps because (the gods think) it is enough, the water dried and we came to Mabatuan.
When we came to Mabatuan, there was no food.
There is no food, so our forefathers thought that we can sow and grow some food.
We go to look for seeds and find seeds like seeds of dry rice.
After the rice bear seeds, we harvest and pound the rice with mortars.
Because there was mortar before, we have to make it by ourselves.
There was no electricity, and the forefathers could not think of other ways but using hands to pound the rice.
And we cooked, and that is how we live our lives.
Afterwards, we live in Mabatuan.
When the Japanese ruled Taiwan, they said that if we move downward, they would teach us how to farm.
We did move downward here, and the place we're staying now is called Sabawqil.
As for why it is called Mabatuan, it's because the place we came from, our origin, was the land called Mabatuan.
Then we come to Tapin.
And we really have nothing to eat.
The Japanese say, "we will teach you farming so that you know how to farm your own land."
The pieces of flat land down below.
I truly think our lives in the place called Mabatuan is not really good.
Actually, such saying may be right; anyway, I am not quite sure.
Old people like me cannot comment on the thoughts of those who take care of us (the government).
So I say our lives in Mabatuan are relly not good.
Luckily, the government is teaching us how to live.
The government says that you have to work hard and grow all kinds of produce like fruits and corn. You have to work or you will starve to die.
We don't know much probably because we Atayal live with wild animals.
We didn't know each other before, but now you teach us your mother tongue so we know and understand each other now.
(The government) takes care of Atayal people, and we start learning languages of Chinese, Hakka, and Southern Min.
I've been thinking that our lives in the beginning are really not good.

I made it myself!
You're really talented. Does it take a long time to make?
Depends on the situation, but it takes at least three to five months or even longer. After soaking, steaming, and cooling the millet, the koji is pounded into powdered form, sprinkled on top of the millet, stirred well, packed into urns, and poured with a certain percentage of cold boiled water, then sealed and stored in a cellar. The longer the rice is stored, the more it dissolves, the more fluid the sake becomes, and the better the flavor. Let time brew the wine! Wait patiently

This holiday, my sister and I went to Taitung to visit my uncle.
We took the train from Taipei to Taitung.

The station is not far from my uncle's house, and it's just a short drive away.
In the ranch, my uncle took us to feed the sheep and ride horses.
In the evening, we went to the city to have dinner together.
There are a lot of cars in the city, so we go there by motorcycle.
When we were about to leave, we found that the motorcycle had been stolen, so we had to leave by bus.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
After I went to college, I took a course on aboriginal culture and learned that the aboriginal people in Taiwan have various and rich cultures.
So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in Tayal, as well as Truku, Hokkien and Japanese.
I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is an Truku, and he knows many Hokkien at work, so he can speak so many languages.
During our interview, the old man talked about a lot of traditional knowledge about hunting.
Although we could't fully understand it, we could record it on our cell phones and listen to it more.
When I was young, I didn't understand the culture of my ethnic group, and I was a little embarrassed that I was an aborigine.
The more I know, the more I feel that being a Tayal is unique and something to be proud of.
My younger brother is going home this evening.
My grandma and I went to the market to buy chickens and prepared a delicious dinner for my younger brother.

We bought pineapples and peaches.
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
Grandma thought it was too expensive and asked the boss if it could be cheaper.
But the boss said that it is already very cheap and cannot be reduced any further.
The boss next door said, come and buy my fish, my fish is big and cheap.
In the end we bought chicken and fish, and went home to cook a table of food.
The younger brother called back and said that the army suddenly couldn't take a vacation and would not be back until the next Sunday.
We invited friends and family to have a great dinner together.
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
But he has a bad habit of often borrowing things but not returning them.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
One day, we all went on an outing together.
On the way, Hayung wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
He borrowed toilet paper from his classmates, but everyone told him that I didn't bring them either.
Hayung burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
The classmate told him, because you didn't bring it yourself, and you wouldn't return the things lent to you!
The next day at school, Hayung arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
Hayung apologized to the students and said that he would definitely bring his own things in the future, and thanked the classmates for their willingness to lend him things before.
My dad is a hunter of the tribe.

Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
Dad said that he would take me with me when I grew up.
The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Dad saw it and told me that I will be a very good hunter in the future.
Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.

I was late for school this morning.
When I was going to school, I forgot to bring my backpack.
I didn't bring anything with me.
During class, I and my classmates read the textbook together.
During the exam, a classmate lent me a pen and an eraser.
The teacher told me, Wake up earlier next time and don't be late again!""
We study together in the Skikun tribe.
We often listen to the elders telling stories together, and we both can speak the Tayal proficiently.
I am tall and overweight, while Silan is short and thin.
Silan is very energetic, and everyone likes him a lot.
Today was the school's sports day, and the school organized many competitions.
There were tug of war, soccer, running, dancing, and archery.
I participated in the running competition.
When I was running, I fell down, and my knees were bleeding.
But I stood up and continued running forward.
Everyone was happy when I reached the finish line.
Although I didn't get first place, I'm glad because I completed the race.
Yesterday, my father and I visited my uncle.
My uncle injured his foot.
He told us that there was a hole in the roof of his house.
He fell off the roof while repairing it.
My father brought beef and betel nuts for my uncle.
My uncle and I chatted in the room, and he shared many stories.
In 2022, the government announced that indigenous identification cards can include tribal names separately.
I interviewed Pasang Yawi, a young tribal member who has long been advocating for the inclusion of tribal names on identification cards.
We had arranged to visit his home this holiday for the interview.
During the interview, he introduced to me the origin of his name and also introduced me to his family and tribe.
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
He told me that using Chinese characters could not accurately convey his name, and others would still call him \Ba Xian Sheng
Pasang Yawi said, \The names written in indigenous languages are our true names. My name represents our ethnic group
Yesterday, I went to the market with my grandmother to set up a stall. My grandmother brought a lot of vegetables that she grew herself and also prepared indigenous cuisine for everyone.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
Our goods sold out quickly, and my grandmother said, \It's all thanks to your help.\""
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
Seeing my grandmother's passion for traditional food, I feel very proud and honored.
