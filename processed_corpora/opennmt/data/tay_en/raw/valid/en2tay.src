I know that even now, there are some around us who see no need to apologize. But that is the most important reason why I am representing the government to issue this apology today. To see what was unfair in the past as a matter of course, or to treat the pain of other ethnic peoples as an unavoidable part of human development, this is the first mindset that we, standing here today, resolve to change and overturn.
Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.

After (the harvest) is dried, they would thresh millet with a mortar, because there was no machine in the past.
That is the thing.
Probably they think, "Let's try our crop and see how good it is."
This should be real. Thank God very much for permission.
I'll describe the origins of our ancestors in the past.
From then on we have sowed.
Living like that is also good, because there is less to worry about.
We aborigines here, let's all work hard, so that we can live well on this land.
Even God will take care of us.
They go to lay traps made with ropes.
We stabbed and, because I was afraid as a kid, I climbed up a tree because I was afraid that it would come and bite me, I thought.
We came home.
I asked my late father why there was only meat to eat.

At daybreak, they returned with their prey.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
The pigeon pea soup and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
I arrived at school at seven today.
I go to school every day, I learn the Tayal language every day, and I want to tell my mother.
I am 10 years old.
We ate bread on the grass, the sun was shining on us, and it was very warm.
On the way home, I made a wish with the stars
I also like grandpa's tea, it's tasted good too.
Today the teacher took us to the zoo, and we lined up at the gate to buy tickets.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in Atayal, as well as Hakka and Japanese.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
Kaynu' burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
The next day at school, Kaynu' arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
We had arranged to visit his home this holiday for the interview.
He told me that using Chinese characters could not accurately convey his name, and others would still call him \Ku Xian Sheng
I live with my father, mother, brother and sister.
My brothers and sisters and I will catch frogs together.
The watermelon grown by grandpa is very sweet and really delicious.
There are elephants, horses and tigers in the zoo. I have never seen these animals before. I was really happy to see them today.
During our interview, the old man talked about a lot of traditional knowledge about hunting.
We bought water spinach, yams and carrots.
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
On the way, Pasan wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Before I left, my uncle praised me for growing taller and becoming more handsome.
