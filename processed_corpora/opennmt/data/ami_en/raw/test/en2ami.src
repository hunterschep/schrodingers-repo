The story I wish to tell you tonight is about the Alikakay. The Amis living in the north once led a happy life, and each couple enjoyed their life together before the Alikakay came to live near their villages. All of the children played and laughed happily, and the life of every family was peaceful. No one knew exactly when those people appeared, but they called themselves Alikakay. Each one of that group was tall and seductive. They built up a small village in Palik near the village of the Amis. It surprised the Amis that they spent their time frolicking around and never raised any poultry.
"FOREIGNERS WHO KNOW HOW TO PRACTICE MAGIC"
ALL CHILDREN IN AMIS VILLAGES THE SKILLS OF CLIMBING THE BETEL-NUT TREE
MALE RANKS AMONG THE AMIS
Take the rank system of Cividi'an, a village on the east coast of Taiwan. There are nine ranks. The highest level is called Lalaw; its members hold regular meetings to make decisions concerning community affairs. The second one is called Alamay (the highest clouds in the sky). The third is called Alatiwas, named after the sorcerer Tiwas who delt with all special ceremonies in the village. The fourth rank is called Alavagas, which is the name of a tree whose wood is good for building houses. The fifth rank is the Matavok, which means that this group consisted of many clever and deliberate people. The sixth is called Ma'orad, meaning "rain" in the Amis language; rain nourishes all things on earth. The remaining groups are the Ma'olac, the Ma'oway, and the Alemet.
The young may also be divided into nine groups according to the nature of their duties. The lowest rank is the Makateloc, who follow the commands given by higher groups. Like the lowest rank in the army, they do whatever they are asked to do, and are thus the basic and most essential workers in any communal undertaking. The second group is called the Paafangay, who must always be ready to support the first group whenever needed. Next come the Mitalodo'ay, the instructors of the first two ranks. Then come the Milalingay, whose main responsibility is to examine or judge which group has performed well; they have the right to correct any one who makes mistakes. The fifth rank, the Mitelongay, is the central command, carrying out out all orders given by the elders. The Misimaway is the sixth group. The highest three ranks are Pahanhanay, Halo'ay, and Kalas. They are all held in high esteem, and sometimes give their suggestions on important decisions.
THE MOST EXPERIENCED AND SKILLED RANK
When the sun sets in the west, the youth of the village start to dance around the fire at the dancing site. The burning of the fire, the Sa'aniwan, represents vitality and the blessings which our ancestors have given us. When the fire stops burning, all dancing and singing ends. The main purpose of this night's ceremony is to call and welcome the spirits and our ancestors to share everything we have. Women must not come to the center of the dancing square. There are two things being done tonight: teaching everyone about our history, and promoting the young men to the next rank.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN MAY TAKE PART IN THE DANCING CIRCLE
THE FAREWELL PARTY ONLY HANDLED BY THE WOMEN OF THE VILLAGE
BARBECUE NEAR THE RIVERSIDE
After they had lived together for a year, Lalatan became pregnant. She told her husband the story about her how she came to this island. Oh God! It was incest, but they could do nothing about their sin. Not long after they married, Lalatan gave birth to a healthy baby. Then Doci told her they had to go back to the place where they had landed. Following the road which Lalatan had walked over, they came back to their landing place. They were surprised to find many tall betel trees, along with persimmon, longan, and breadfruit, near the place where Doci had turned the canoe over. Their feeling of relief was indescribable - they no longer needed to worry about feeding themselves. Because they were both homesick, they agreed that the place where they were living should be named after their home, which was called Lagasan.
5. If you walk into a big green forest and you are caught in the rain, the rice you have planted will bring you a good harvest.
3. Give up doing what you want to do and stay home for a day or more.
If at night a dog barks at someone, it is not significant. But if the sound of barking is like crying, it means that there is a ghost haunting the village. Everyone should stay at home, lest terrible things be seen.
How do we avoid bad luck and prevent misfortune from following us? 1. Should you meet with any sort of inauspicious omen, stop whatever you are doing, and try again at a later time. You may go to bed and sleep until someone calls, and then resume what you were doing. 2. When encountering strange phenomena such as a snake lying in one's path or a small blackbird crying sorrowfully, the best thing is to just turn the other way; this will prevent harm. 3. If you consider a particular situation to be very serious, break off all plans and flee. It is better to give up something than to meet with misfortune. 4. The final way is to ask for a Sorcerer or a sorceress to exorcise the bad luck.
"Just like that reason the elders' having had built the ADAWAG."
"Before Japanese times, many enemies attacked and destroyed the village."

I only have an umbrella, let's stick together!
When do I have to pay you back?
No, this is what mom bought.
We're releasing fishing nets to catch fish.
It was a leg-rigged rope trap, and we used it to catch Shankiang.
My eraser is missing.
Goodbye teacher.

I am working at school.
I want two bottles and a pack of rice.

Hello, how much is this bunch of vegetables?
Kacaw, I forgot to bring my pen. Can you lend me one?
Can you lend me the pen for a second? I will return to you immediately.

Yesterday, I went to visit my grandpa in the tribe.
After lunch, we went to the vegetable garden to pick vegetables.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in Teruku, as well as Atayal, Hakka and Ngayngay.
I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is an Teruku, and he knows many Hakkas at work, so he can speak so many languages.
During our interview, the old man talked about a lot of traditional knowledge about hunting.
My younger brother is going home this evening.
But the boss said that it is already very cheap and cannot be reduced any further.
On the way, Kacaw wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
The next day at school, Kacaw arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.

We said loudly, "Hi, teacher."
I go to school every day, I learn the 'Amis language every day, and I want to tell my mother.

There are three brothers and sisters in our family.
I like our family very much.
There were no clouds in the sky at night, and the stars came out.
When we arrived in Taitung, my uncle drove to the station to pick us up.
There are a lot of cars in the city, so we go there by motorcycle.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
Although we could't fully understand it, we could record it on our cell phones and listen to it more.
My grandma and I went to the market to buy chickens and prepared a delicious dinner for my younger brother.
We bought pineapples and peaches.
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
I have a classmate named Kacaw, he often forgets to bring things.
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.

One day, we all went on an outing together.

Dad said that he would take me with me when I grew up.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
My father speaks the Pangcah language with us at home.
The station is not far from my uncle's house, and it's just a short drive away.

During class, I and my classmates read the textbook together.
We had arranged to visit his home this holiday for the interview.
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
