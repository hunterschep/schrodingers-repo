<2ami> He thus grabbed one frog. 'This is my frog,' thought he.

<2ami> He went down to put in the three baskets below.

<2ami> The story I wish to tell you tonight is about the Alikakay. The Amis living in the north once led a happy life, and each couple enjoyed their life together before the Alikakay came to live near their villages. All of the children played and laughed happily, and the life of every family was peaceful. No one knew exactly when those people appeared, but they called themselves Alikakay. Each one of that group was tall and seductive. They built up a small village in Palik near the village of the Amis. It surprised the Amis that they spent their time frolicking around and never raised any poultry.

<2ami> Take the rank system of Cividi'an, a village on the east coast of Taiwan. There are nine ranks. The highest level is called Lalaw; its members hold regular meetings to make decisions concerning community affairs. The second one is called Alamay (the highest clouds in the sky). The third is called Alatiwas, named after the sorcerer Tiwas who delt with all special ceremonies in the village. The fourth rank is called Alavagas, which is the name of a tree whose wood is good for building houses. The fifth rank is the Matavok, which means that this group consisted of many clever and deliberate people. The sixth is called Ma'orad, meaning "rain" in the Amis language; rain nourishes all things on earth. The remaining groups are the Ma'olac, the Ma'oway, and the Alemet.

<2ami> The young may also be divided into nine groups according to the nature of their duties. The lowest rank is the Makateloc, who follow the commands given by higher groups. Like the lowest rank in the army, they do whatever they are asked to do, and are thus the basic and most essential workers in any communal undertaking. The second group is called the Paafangay, who must always be ready to support the first group whenever needed. Next come the Mitalodo'ay, the instructors of the first two ranks. Then come the Milalingay, whose main responsibility is to examine or judge which group has performed well; they have the right to correct any one who makes mistakes. The fifth rank, the Mitelongay, is the central command, carrying out out all orders given by the elders. The Misimaway is the sixth group. The highest three ranks are Pahanhanay, Halo'ay, and Kalas. They are all held in high esteem, and sometimes give their suggestions on important decisions.

<2ami> When the sun sets in the west, the youth of the village start to dance around the fire at the dancing site. The burning of the fire, the Sa'aniwan, represents vitality and the blessings which our ancestors have given us. When the fire stops burning, all dancing and singing ends. The main purpose of this night's ceremony is to call and welcome the spirits and our ancestors to share everything we have. Women must not come to the center of the dancing square. There are two things being done tonight: teaching everyone about our history, and promoting the young men to the next rank.

<2ami> After they had lived together for a year, Lalatan became pregnant. She told her husband the story about her how she came to this island. Oh God! It was incest, but they could do nothing about their sin. Not long after they married, Lalatan gave birth to a healthy baby. Then Doci told her they had to go back to the place where they had landed. Following the road which Lalatan had walked over, they came back to their landing place. They were surprised to find many tall betel trees, along with persimmon, longan, and breadfruit, near the place where Doci had turned the canoe over. Their feeling of relief was indescribable - they no longer needed to worry about feeding themselves. Because they were both homesick, they agreed that the place where they were living should be named after their home, which was called Lagasan.

<2ami> If at night a dog barks at someone, it is not significant. But if the sound of barking is like crying, it means that there is a ghost haunting the village. Everyone should stay at home, lest terrible things be seen.

<2ami> How do we avoid bad luck and prevent misfortune from following us? 1. Should you meet with any sort of inauspicious omen, stop whatever you are doing, and try again at a later time. You may go to bed and sleep until someone calls, and then resume what you were doing. 2. When encountering strange phenomena such as a snake lying in one's path or a small blackbird crying sorrowfully, the best thing is to just turn the other way; this will prevent harm. 3. If you consider a particular situation to be very serious, break off all plans and flee. It is better to give up something than to meet with misfortune. 4. The final way is to ask for a Sorcerer or a sorceress to exorcise the bad luck.
