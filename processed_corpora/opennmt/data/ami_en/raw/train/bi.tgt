President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
O pikomod ni Cay-Eng-Wen Cong-tong a mita'ong to Yin-co-min-co a tilid.
Let me put in simple terms why we are apologizing to the indigenous peoples. Four hundred years ago, there were already people living in Taiwan. These first inhabitants lived their lives and had their own languages, cultures, customs, and domains. But then, without their consent, another group of people arrived on these shores, and in the course of history, took everything from the first inhabitants who, on the land they have known most intimately, became displaced, foreign, non-mainstream, and marginalized.
Sakameden ako ko sowal a paini, nawiro mita'ong kako to Yin-co-min-co. Onini a pala^ i Taywan i, 'ayaw no 400 a mihcaan iraayto ko maro'ay a tamdaw. O nangra sa a fana' a ma'orip, iraay ko sowal, serangawan, lekakawa no 'orip ato saliyoh no 'orip. Nikawrira, ira ko nai papotalay onini a pala^ a tamdaw a midefongay.
There is a book called "The General History of Taiwan" published in 1920. In its foreword are these words: "Taiwan had no history. The Dutch pioneered it, the Koxinga Kingdom built it, and the Qing Empire managed it." This is a typical Han view of history. The truth is that indigenous peoples have been here for thousands of years, with rich culture and wisdom that have been passed down through generations. But we only know to write history from the perspective of the dominant. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Ira ko cecay " O sawayan no Taywan tong se " sanay a codad. Sowal sa i pali'ayaw a sowal " Awaay ko saway no Taywan. O Olanda^ ko militapangay, ci Cen Cen-kong ko midemakay, o Cin-tay ko parafaray" sa ko sowal, o no payrang a harateng koni. Nawhani, i'ayaw no pinapina a patek a mihcaan i, iraa:yto ko Yin-co-min-co a fanacadan toni a pala^. O kadofahay a serangawan ato taneng i marayraya:y to itini. Orasaka, komod han no mako ko Cen-fo a mita'ong to Yin-co-min-co.
The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
O pipatay pi'afas no Olanda ato ni Cen Cen-kong to 'orip no Tangafolan; piri'ang no Cing-caw ato pisapangcah no Ripon a nikowan, tangasa i lotokay enaray sanay a pikowan no Min-kok. O tayniay i Taywan a mikowanay tina 400 a mihcaan i, sahto o sala'is ko sapi'afas ato sapiri'ang to saka 'orip no Yin co-min-co. Orasaka, komod han ako ko Cen-fo a mita'ong to Yin-co-min-co.
Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Pakayni i nanaman no 'orip no Yin-co- min-co ato taneng no to'as ko saka saysay, saka nga'ay no niyaro' ato taliyokay a pinalengaw. Nikawrira, yo mapatireng no aniniay a Kitakit ko sapihalaka to niyaro' a demak i, mapalasawad to ko lekakawa ato pakoniyaniyah a 'imar no Yin-co-min-co. Mapalasawad ko yofayof ato caayto ko mamahayda ko salongoc no 'orip. Orasaka, kotay han ako ko Cen-fo a mita'ong to Yin-co-minco.
Without the knowledge of the Yami tribe, the government stored nuclear waste on Orchid Island. Tribe members on the island had to suffer the negative consequences. For this, I apologize to the Yami people on behalf of the government.
Toya mihcaan, yo mafokil ko Fotod a tamdaw i, liapa^ han no Cen-fo a midokdok mi'tli i Fotod ko cisawarakay a 'afo no he-neng. Oni ko saka makari'ang ko 'orip no i Fotoday a tamdaw. Orasaka, komod han no mako ko Cen-fo a mita'ong to Yin-co- minco.
Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.
Yo midefong i Taywan ko sapapotalay a tamdaw i, sa'ayaway a makari'ang i, oya maro'ay i no^etipan a dafdaf a Tangafolan a finacadan. Oya madado^do^ay a mikowanay ko palasawaday to Tangafolan a finacadan. Orasaka, komod han no mako ko Cen-fo a mita'ong to Tangafolan a finacadan.
After the democratic transition, the country began to respond to the appeals of indigenous movements. The government made certain promises and efforts. Today, we have an Indigenous Peoples Basic Law that is quite advanced. However, government agencies have not given sufficient weight to this law. Our actions have not been fast enough, comprehensive enough or sound enough. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Irikor no pipasasiyor to pikowan i, na irato ko pipaca'of no Kitakit to salongoc no Yin-co-min-co. Mihayda ato misa'icel ko Cen-fo a midemak tonian. Mapasadakay to no mita ko "paranaan a rikec no Yin-co-min-co" nika onini a rikec i, caay ka lalen ko yofayof no Cen- fo a milayap. Caay ka narikay kasolinga' ato caay ka ha^emin ko midemakan no niyam. Orasaka, komod han no mako ko Cen-fo a mita'ong to Yin-co-min-co.
Our efforts have fallen short, and succeeding generations have been blind to this inadequacy. Because of this, your hardship has continued to this day. For this we are truly sorry. Today's apology is long overdue, but it is a beginning. I do not expect any one speech or phrase of apology to wipe away four centuries of pain and suffering by the indigenous peoples. But I do hope with all my heart that today's apology will set this country and all its people on the path towards reconciliation.
Caay ka tatodong ko pisa'icel no niyam, to kasarayray, o saka hatini namo a mapades tahanini i, o nikaca kanarikay no niyam a pakahapinang to rarima no namo, orasaka, maanen aca haw. O pita'ong anini, talacowa maapacay to, nika o litapang koni. 400 a mihcaan o roray ato pades no Yin-co-min-co i, caay ka nga'ay pakayni i cecay a tilid ato pita'ong a malahdaw sanay ko pinanay no mako. Nikawrira, so'linay ko hinatala no mako, o nipita'ong anini i, i laloma'ay ho nonini a kitakit a tamdaw i, pasayraen i kasasisolol ko litapang ko nga'ay.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
I serangawan no Yin-co-min-co, ano ira ko pararaway to cima a tamdaw, ano mangalay a masasisolol i, palisaoten no mato'asay ko miri'angay ato makari'angay a tamdaw. Masa'opo^ caira i, caay ko nika pita'ong a cecay, alapasadak caira to nai faloco'ay a sowal. Yo maherek a paini to so'linay a rayray no demak i, ta: han no mato'asay a matatakid, mata'lifayto a demak i ta'lif hato. Onian koya "Sbalay" sanay.
Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
O litapang konini, malaheciay ko kasasisolosolol a demak, caay ka i Yin-co- min-co ato Tangafolan a finacahan, o Cen- fo ko pi'arawan. Mafana'ay kako deng o pita'ong caayay katatodong, kianini litapang mihalaka ko Cen-fo to midemakan no Yin- co-min-co, itini tona demak a mahapinang so'linay misololay konini a Kitaki.
Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
So'linen ako a palosiyang, o papatirengen i Cong-tong-fo ko "yofayof no mocelay a saway no Yin-co-min-co ato mifalic palamo^celay a iing-kay." Kako o Cong-tong ko kakeridan nonini a sa'opo^, malakapot to dayhiw no kalofinacadan mikilim to mocelay a saway, ikor i, malecaday ko paenaran a malacafay mihalaka to demak no Kitakit.
Where modern laws and indigenous traditional cultures are at odds, we will set up an Indigenous Legal Service Center with a high degree of cultural sensitivity, to reduce through institutional design the growing clashes between indigenous customs and modern laws.
Oya aniniay a rikec ato serangawan no Yin- co-min-co, iraay ko masasiikoray, orasaka, patirengen ita ko mafana'ay to no rikec a " saki rikec a tayal to Yin-co-min-co a sa'opo^" sanay, ta masaysay malowan ko rawraw i nanaman no 'orip no Yin-co-min-co ato sakedec a rikec no Kitakit.
At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.
I kangodo^ to Tangafolan ao Tangafolan kami sanay to 'orip no niyah i, 'ayaw no 9 a folad saka 30 a romi'ad i, maainiini kami to pakayniay i rikec, ta maanen a pafeli ko Tangafolan a finacadan to malonangraan a tatodong.
Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.
Anini herek no lahok, pasa'opo^en niyam ko polong no Yin-co-min-co sin-cen a pikayki. Paratoh ko Cen-fo to adihayay a mihalakaan a demak. To mihcacaan no 8 a folad saka 1 a romi'ad, o paparatoh ko Sin-cen-yin i polong no Yin-co-min-co to nidemakan a mo^celay a saway ato fa^lohay a palamocelan a demak.

To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.
Longocen ako ko iniay, minengnengay to tilifi ato mitiya polong no Yin-co-min-co, malacafay kita a pawacay mikantok tonini a demak. Nanay sa'icelen namo o Yin-co-min-co a mitiwatiw, paini to fana', ta malahci ko nihaydaan no Cen- fo, so'lin mifalic ko moraraway a demak i'ayaw.
I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.
Aray han ako ko polong no Yin-co-min-co, kamo ko mipalalay to polong no Kitakit, onini a nipasaripa'an a sera^ ato rayray no to'as, iraay ko caay ko mamafalic a satadamaanay, onini a satadamaanay i, o papafelien to sakangod ciira.
In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.
Iikor to i, pakaynien niyam i pilahci to mihalakaan a tayal, to saka caay ka lasawad kapawan to sowal ato serangawan ko teloc no Yin-co-min-co, ato maro'ay tonini a pala^ no Taywan a finacadan, ta caayto ka matiya o pakoyocay a misatiwatiwal i pala^ no niyah.
I call upon all citizens to seize the opportunities offered by this day - to join together, work hard, and build a country of justice, a country of true diversity and equality.
Longocen no mako ko polong no finawlan, pakayni tona demak anini, malacafay kita a palowad to mo^celay masolinga'ay a kitakit, o cecay a so'linay malalenay a kitakit.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights Preamble
Kalaeno No Kakarayan Kngli NoTamlawSwanyam Shoal No Aayaw
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law, Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations, Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge, Now, therefore, The General Assembly, Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.

Hello.
nga'ay ho.
My hometown is in Ciwkangan, in Taitung, in Kakacawan.
o niyaro' ako itira i poson i kakacawan ko ciwkangan.
left home and went to Pingtung to study until I graduated from high school.
miliad to loma' tayra i heto a mitilid tahira to i kokiw maherek misawad to itira.
I was about to serve in the army.
mi harakat to to sakalahitai.
'You can marry now.'
maedeng to kiso cifafahi' sa'an saka.
After I got married, I came to Taipei immediately.
maherek cifafahi' kako tangsol sa tayni i taypak.
It was around 1974 (when I came) to Taipei.
itini i taypak i ano saosien ko mihecaan itira i enem polo' ira ko saka tolo.
I have worked there for thirty years.
tolo to polo' ko mihecaan ko tayal ako itira.
It is in 1986 that I engaged in the work on Amis.
toninian a tayal no mako pakayniay to no pancah itira i saka pito polo' mihecaan sa ira ko lima.
I was lucky to meet Professor Afan.
malomed kako itiya ira ci Afan a singsi.
'I am going to compile an Amis dictionary,' he said.
misanga' kako to citen no pancah sa'an ko sowal nira saka.
He is looking for someone to translate Amis into Chinese.
mikilimay to mami falic to tilid no pancah malo mifalic sa no holam.
Therefore I accepted the job then.
saka mitayalay kako itiya.
From then on, I realized that the Amis language is beautiful.
ta mafana' kako to ka tada kafangcal ko tilid no pancah.
The speech and the structure of the Amis language are all beautiful.
o caciaw no pancah o faco no pancah mae'min a fangcal.
That was what I thought then.
sa'an ko faloco' ako itiya.
Only by collecting Amis narratives could we learn about the Amis culture in the past and present.
awa'ay ko sowal saka itinitini aca i kimad no pancah a miala ta ma fana' to orip no pancah itiya ho tahira sa anini.
This way of teaching children is not good enough.
haenhan ko pasifana' to wawa ca'ay ka reko saka.
Thus I published a book that year, as teaching materials for children.
toya miheca misanga kako to codad malo codad no pasifana' to wawa.
Thus I worked on the Amis language up till now.
saka tahanini sa ko tayal no mako to pakayniay to no pancah.
One day, there was a couple. were old.
yo ira ko ccay a romi'ad ira ko tatosaay malaramoday a mato'asay to.
came to the field in the mountain to till the field to grow peanuts.

didn't know 'kudasing' was the name of what they were growing.
ca' kafana' to nika o kodasing ko ngangan nora papaloma'an nira.
they were hoeing, a Taiwanese passed by.
ya matira cangra mipitao mi paloma' ira mi tafesiw ko ccay o taywan ito.
'Wow, the old people!' The Taiwanese saw the old couple work hard to grow peanuts.
watah kora mato'asay sa kora taywan a minengneng to nika sainaneng sa koya mato'asay a tatosa mipitao paloma' toya kodasing sa.
The Taiwanese, 'How hardworking!'
kakolacing sa koya taywan haw.
The old couple, 'Ah, (this is called) Kudasing.'
a o kodasing ko koninian sa to koya mato'asay a tatosa sa o kodasing.
Peanuts were thus called 'Kudasing'.
han to ko ngangan nora kodasing.
'Kulacing' in Taiwanese became the name of peanuts in Amis, 'kudasing'.
kolacing sa ko taywan haw o kolacing han no kodasing han to ita o pangcah misaAmisay konini o kodasing.
The name 'kudasing' is passed down.
konini o rayray no sakaira no kodasing sanay a sowal.
There was a child who really liked the dog and the frog.
ira ko ccay a wawa so'lin maolah cingra tonini a waco ato o takola'.
He really wanted to catch the frog, he put in his urn.
so'lin miala cingra toyanan a takola' paro'en nira i koreng nira.
Seeing the frog, he was really happy.
manengneng nira kora takola' so'lin a lipahak cingra.
He slept.

He got up in the morning and saw that the frog was gone. He was sad then.

Where was the frog that I put in the urn?
i cowa to kiya mitelian ako itini toya koreng ya takola'.
He was so sad that he looked for.
sa ko rarom no faloco' nira itiya mikilim to cingra.
He started to look around, but didn't find it; perhaps went to the mountain.
nengneng ito cingra i salawacan nengnenghan nira awa matama itiya to mararoco' so'lin a tata'ak a latek tayni i lotok.
'Where is it?', he said.
i cowacowa kiya sa'an.
He walked on the road to the mountains.
romakat to cingra tayni i lalan i lotolotokan.
He looked around and he thought that perhaps was in the hole on the ground.
so'lin nengnenghan nira a latek itini i tepong nona sota' onini kiya nasa ko harateng nira.
He called the frog, and it turned out that a vole came out.
anganghan nira miangang koyanan a takola' nira miceli' nengnenghan nira sadak sa'an onini o ko o kolafaw.
He was surprised to see the vole.
itira kacekok no faloco' nira a minengneng toya kolafaw.
The dog was frightened and ran away.
so'lin a mapacekok milaliw to kiya waco nira.
Perhaps was in the hole of the tree, he thought so.

He called the frog; towards the hole of the tree.
nengnenghan nira a miceli' koya takola' nira tiya epong niya kilang.
He shouted towards the tree hole, but a crow went out.
sadak sa'an tiya ya miceli'an tiya epong noya kilang sadak sa o anikak.
He was scared and fell down and tumbled onto the ground.
matalaw cingra matefad a malokelon a itira i sota' cingra.
They were really afraid of the crow that he shouted at.
nengnenghan nira so'lin matalaw tiya mi angangan nira a anikak matalaw cangra.
It would be better to stay on the rock.
kaitini to ko nga'ayay tona fokeloh.
'I couldn't keep a fast hold on the rock,' he said.
itira kako a ca'ay karawis sa'an.
would rather stand up.
tayra toya fokeloh cingra i toya a tomireng.
He really stood up, seeing a goat.
so'lin tomireng cingra maaraw nira konini siri no lotok.
He felt scared again.
itira ho ko katalaw no faloco' nira.
Running away, he didn't know where he went.
comikay to tala cowacowa to mafokil to cingra.
He fell into the water and swam there for fear of the goat.
hinamhan ta kefeng itini i i ranom itira to cingra dangoy sa to a midangoy toni katalaw toyanan a siri.
What could he do? He swam to the shore.
so'lin maanen talahekal to cingra na midangoy.
He felt relieved because he thought that he could find.
nasa ko hinatala nira to karaheker nira a mikilim.
He called, and the frog also called him.
celi'han nira so'lin miceli' to kiya takola' itini i cingranan.
He kept looking and called the frog.
nengneng papinengneng hato nira miceli' niya takola' cingra.
There were many children.

Or his friends? He felt relieved.
anca widang nira hakini sa ko raheker no faloco' nira nanoyan to i.
My description is like this.

There was a child, at night (he stayed with) his partner and friend, a dog and a frog.
ira koya ccay a wawa dadaya to i o tihi nira o widang nira o ccay waco ato ccay takola'.
He put the frog in his bottle, because the frog was his most cherished friend.
telihan kiya takola' itini i talid nira nawhani kalimelaan nira a widang kona takola'.
The dog made a thorough search, but didn't find the frog.
ya waco sa i safohafohat sa mipadang mikilim ca'ay pakatama.
The child searched his house for the frog, but didn't find it.
wadwadeng nira ko loma ningra i ca'ay pakatama niya wawa.
The dog accidentally put its head into the bottle to search the bottle (for the frog), and his head entered the bottle. The dog and the child kept calling.

They looked for the frog.

The dog was not careful and fell down. Afterwards, the bottle was broken.

The child took the dog and held it in the arms.
maala to niya kaemangay wawa kiya waco afofohan nira koya waco ningra.
The child kept calling his frog, but didn't find it.

There were bees flying in front of them at a distance.

The dog kept jumping and wanted to catch the bees.
sacekocekor sa kiya waco sapi tatoyan tiya tatekoh.
There was a beehive in front of them.

The dog was there. When the dog saw the bees, it wanted to climb up and shook the tree.

The child kept shouting towards the hole.
ya wawa saceliceli'han nira ko kiya ofang i laeno' i.
searched the hole, but the frog was not there; a mouse went out instead.
sa i ofang no sota' i nenghan i awa kiya takola' oya masadakay sa i ira kiya edo a masadak.
He thought that perhaps my frog was inside the tree hole.
harateng sa cingra i latek ira i ya ofang niya kilang kiya takola' no mako sa i.
He stretched out his hand to see (if the frog was inside), but it turned out that what came out was an owl.
mi solsol to kamay a tayra minengneng nenghan masadakay i o ekong.
The owl came out.
masadak kiya ekong.
After the dog shook the tree, all the bees came out and chased the dog, so the dog kept running.
nika ya waco sa pakayni pingiyangi nira tiya kilang i masadak ma 'min koya tatekoh mila'op toya waco cikay sa to kiya waco.
After the owl came out, the child was scared and hid himself.
na wawa i pakayni toya ira ko ekong masadak matalaw milimek.
ran away, ignoring the dog and the child.
comikay to masiday to tatosa ya waco ato kaemangay wawa.
But the child wanted to look for the frog. climbed up a rock.
nika sapikiliman kiya wawa takola' sa nira i kalic sa to ccay fokeloh.
He held on to the tree, but the tree turned out to be a deer.

What went out was a deer.
o lonem koya nalonem koya masadakay.
He climbed onto the deer, so the deer kept running.

He didn't care about the dog and the deer.

The child and the dog fell into the stream.

After they fell into the stream, and after a long time, the child heard the frog's sound.
pakayni toya tefad nangra i alo' sa to tiya nanom nika halafin matengil niya wawa ko soni no takola'.
The child said to the dog, 'Don't speak. Our friend, the frog, might be here.'
n han nira koya waco aka kacaciyao latek ira tini ko takola' ya widang no mita sa.
He saw that the frog had many friends there.

'"Ah, my frog was here," he thought,' I said.

The frog leapt towards them.
harafin maaraw to nira aya kiya takola' sa no mako sa ciyao tekor tekor sa koya takola' mira'or cingranan.
Then he told the frog's friends, 'We are going home.'

'The frog is my friend,' said he.
o widang no mako kora takola' han nira.
'Take care,' he said to the frogs.
sanga'ay to ko namo han nira a milicay kiya takola'.

I thought if Turis hadn't come, or if I had not liked his company, we would not have developed a writing system for Amis.

After putting the guavas in the basket, he helped him put the basket on his bike.

The three people passed where the farmer plucked fruit and saw the old man's work. They saw and said 'Wow, so many!' and then went past.

The men of the Amis worked on the farm or went hunting during the daytime, and only the women and children stayed home. Sometimes they grew rice and sweet potatoes. If they went to work on the hillside, the children would follow or accompany them. The elder brothers or sisters took care of the younger ones near the field so the mothers could easily feed their babies when they cried. One day, when a mother wanted to feed her baby, the elder children said, "Hey Mom! you've fed the baby already. Is it necessary to wake it up again?" "Oh! When did I come to feed the baby? I have not touched it since I left it this morning," answered the astonished mother. They hurried to look at the baby, and were very distressed to find that the baby had been dead for quite some time. Its body was cold. Afterward the mother examined the child and found that there was something wrong with its stomach; it seemed so thin. She went nearly mad with grief because of her child's death. When she got home, she heard that the same thing had happened in every family that had a newborn baby. In every village, there were lots of babies killed in the same way.
O mato'asay han no Pancah ili, o fafa'inay han ili, miadop to romi'ad; o fafahi sa ko i loma'ay. Paloma to hafay, paroma to koga.

The clan held a meeting to figure out what had happened to the children, and to discover who had killed them. The magician of the village performed an autopsy on the dead babies and found that all of babies had no liver or small intestine. Everyone was very depressed, and tried to figure out who might have killed their children. One said, "It must be the newcomers, the Alikakay. Since they came to live near us, there is always something strange happening in our village. I have never seen them work on the farm or plant anything. How do they make their living? Recently, they have all disappeared. Where are they?

At last it was agreed that the different villages ruined by the Alikakay had to unite; only by joining forces in battle with the Alikakay could they win. Marang Bawbaw was elected to be the general of all villages. He took charge of everything in the fight with the Alikakay. Marang Bawbaw announced, "Our enemy, the Alikakay, seem strange. If we want to overthrow them, the best way is for the strongest young men in every village to be selected according to their prowess in nine events: the Malenlen (long-distance running], Pafenfeng [throwing stones at a target], Mafekac [100m race], Mipana' [throwing the javelin], Mahahawang [hand-to-hand fighting], Milalefok [wrestling], and Mipatekal [pole-vaulting]. After the young men are selected, I will train them for half a year to a year or more. Then will drive the Alikakay from our land." All agreed.

The general Marang Bawbaw felt dejected and sorrowful because he was unable to do anything to conquer the Alikakay. He rested on a flat rock near the seashore, and soon fell asleep. He dreamed of the Kapit, the sea god. The god told him the secret by which he could defeat the Alikakay. The Amis must use the Polog, a long grass, tying the leaves in knots and hanging them on the front door to exorcise evil spirits. That night Marang Bawbaw assigned some volunteers, very deliberate men, to hang the Polog on the house of each Alikakay family. The next morning the sorcerers and Marang Bawbaw held a sacrificial rite to worship Heaven, the sea god, and their ancestors, asking them to bless all the Amis. After the rite, they found all of the Alikakay sick and frail. Soon their leader came to beseech the Amis for mercy. The Amis were so kind that they agreed to forgive them if they would go away immediately. All the Alikakay walked toward the sea and disappeared out of sight of the Amis. Later all the Amis heard the Alikakay say, "In appreciation for your not punishing us for our past misdeeds, we ask of you only that you offer us three things-betel nut, wine, and glutinous rice cakes- near the sea or near a river every year in June. Then, you will catch a lot of fish. From that time onward, the Alikakay never appeared again. This is the reason reason why the Amis, celebrate the Ilsin Mila'edis in June or early July. After the event, the Amis found that all the young men who had been trained in the mountains were healthy and strong. This practice has been followed ever since. Indeed, the Amis are obliged to follow it forever.

In the village of Lidaw, near Hualien City, people hold a big celebration for their ancestors every two years. During the party, mediums, sorceresses and sorcerers contact the ancestors and ask them to bless every member of the village and give them happiness and health. This ceremony now is always performed by the leader of the mediums, known as the Kamaya. She guides the other mediums in the proper execution of this rite, whose purpose is to bring prosperity to the village for years to come.

Why is it that the Amis still have no written language? I will tell the story of why the Amis language lacks writing. Originally, before the arrival of the Kaagatay ["the invaders," i.e., the chinese], Taiwan was inhabited by the Amis people. When these foreigners came to Taiwan, they saw that the Amis were clever, but that they had no writing system. The Kaagatay said, "Let us both invent a writing system [so that we can communicate with each other]. We will agree to use the better of the two systems." Having made this agreement, the Amis wrote their alphabet on stone, while the Kaagatay wrote theirs on white cork. Then the Kaagatay said, "Throw your masterpiece into the water, and we will throw in our cork. The one that floats will be the one which we use. We will learn it well. What a cunning people they are! After the deal was made, they both threw their works into the Hsiukuluan River. What a pity it was! The stone with our writing sank, while the cork of the Kaagatay floated. For this reason the writing of the Kaagatay has been used since that time. This is also the reason why they claim to be the first inhabitants and the leaders of this island. They forced the Amis to agree to accept their language by saying that because it floated it was better than the writing system of the Amis. Thus it is that our Amis writing system no longer exists.

The groups which actually participate in communal work are the Teloc to Tatelongan; the others just stay in the public house and wait, though sometimes lending a hand if necessary. What kind of work do they do? Everything. They are trained how to serve others. Ordinarily, they take resposibility for protecting the village against enemies. During special events, like the Harvest Festival, they are the main force in making all necessary arrangements. All important decisions are made by the elder groups after conferring with others. If they can't come to an agreement, they will turn to the Tomok [chief] of the village. His suggestions are discussed in making a final decision. The youngest rank, the Teloc, have seven duties: 1. Normal protection of the village. 2. Taking charge of village ceremonies. 3. Dealing with emergencies and helping anyone who needs a hand. 4. Teaching the younger generation proper manners and respect for the elderly. 5. Apprehending burglars and criminals. 6. Carrying out the commands of the elders, especially in matters of communal importance. 7. Hunting, burning off the forest, and building roads for the village.

The busiest time for them is from April to September, In April, they begin practicing all the dances and songs for the harvest festival. Another task is to repair or rebuild the watchhouse or meeting houses of the village, and to construct new roads or paths. June is the season for Mila'edis, catching fish. July, August and September are the most important months for the Amis; during this time they give thanks to the the gods for giving them another harvest year.

Drawing divisions in Amis work ranks is quite different from that of forming troops. The first division is determined according to age. The names of these division are, respectively: Misatataay, Midodo'ay, Paafagay, Kedohan, Mirokrokay, Papetohan, and Spaliloc. The names of the divisions sometimes vary from village to village.

If there is a battle between two tribes or two villages, the rank of the Papedohan is the main force; the last rank is the Sapaliloc, whose main mission in battle is to take care of the wounded. The Sapililoc are regarded as an auspicious force because of their youth and energy-their presence means hope for the future of the tribe. The Mirokrokay are the warriors; their duty is to attack and defeat the enemy. Regardless of their position, all members of the Amis sale work ranks are bound to the regulations which apply to their rank. It is this discipline and unity which makes the Amis a strong group.

THE HARVEST FESTIVAL IN SAANIWAN
ILISIN I SAANIWAN A NIYARO'
In Saaniwan, the Harvest Festival lasts for seven days. Before the event, the young people spend one day fishing in the main river near the village. This is called Pifotigan, which means "the day for fishing." Another day of preparation for the festival is spent cooking traditional foods, including sticky rice bread. This second day is called Pisafelacan. The night of the the second day is called Ka'ifolodan. This is when the real activities start. The names of the days of the festival are: SARAKAT PAKOMODAN, SAKATOSA PAKOMODAN, SAKATOLO PAKOMODAN, SAKASEPAT PAKOMODAN, SAKALIMA PAKOMODAN, PAGAYATAN NO KAPAH, PIPIHAYAN. On the last day we have an activity called Pakelag, which means relaxing with one's own family and friends on the river bank or seashore. Now let me tell you all in detail.

The distribution of work for the ceremonies depends on the number of the young people in the village. Each rank has its special name in accordance with this great event. The names are: LAKOKAY, LATIFO, LAHALAC, LA'ALAPO, LATINGWA, and PAKALONGAY. The responsibilities of each rank during the fishing work are as follows: 1. The Lakokay, the chief of the youth, lead the other ranks in carrying out missions. 2.The Latifo sprinkle the wild walnut, a poisonous plant, on the surface of the river. 3. The Lahalac are responsible for the behavior of the youth: Who is lazy? Who steals fish? 4. The La'alapo take responsibility for picking the fish up and gathering them into the baskets. 5. The Latingwa carry the fish traps or fish baskets. 6. The Pakalogay, the lowest rank, do whatever the elder ranks ask. Any man whose wife is expecting must not go along with the ranks to fish. If he does, the poison may lose its effectiveness in paralyzing the fish.

If women participate, the men must dance with them, or they will not be able to dance and sing earnestly, for fear that someone in the village might die. The oldest man in the village tells people the history of the Saaniwan and the location of the village.

Today, the day known as Salakat Pakomodan, there are many girls, young women, and mothers with children who join the dancing circle at the end. There is also a fire in the middle of the dancing square. All the villagers must take part in the activities today. Each dancer wears the traditional dress appropriate to his rank. On this day everyone has fun, because each person plays an important role in the ceremony and learns how to cooperate and get along with others.

MASS AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL Since all the villagers are Catholics, everyone must attend mass in the morning. Each one must put on traditional costumes, priests and nuns included, because the dancing begins immediately after the mass. We worship our ancestors by attending the mass, and also invite them to share what we have after the ceremony, as a sign of appreciation to them.

PRAISE GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD DEEDS OF THE VILLAGE THIS YEAR
PALIMO TO INANEGAY A TANDAW
THE FEAST FOR THE ELDERS In order to show the long and proud tradition of the Amis, the youth on this day prepare a big feast for older people. A long time ago, the youth went hunting and brought meat to serve the old. Now that the environment doesn't allow us to hunt any more, the young people just collect money from all the ranks and prepare a sumptuous meal. After the meal, they put on performances to entertain the elders. Then all the villagers dance the Pa'inonoran. No one can lead the dance without special experience in impromptu singing and dancing. Should someone dare attempt it, then he or she would be upbraided for bringing bad luck upon the entire village.

THE DIPLOMATIC FEAST The activity held on this evening might be called a diplomatic feast. The villagers invite all the outsiders who have helped the village-construction workers, government leaders, etc.-to join them in a feast. After the lunch, the guests are invited to take part in the dancing and singing.

MATCHING NIGHT When the activities of the Harvest Festival for all villages are almost over, people may choose to take part in whatever activities they want. For the young men, especially those who are unmarried, this day's Pagalatan to Kapah is a very important and practical event, for this is the time that he determines whether the siblings and parents of his beloved will agree to marriage or not. This day also provides entertainment to help release the tensions of the past several days of Harvest Festival activities. Most people feel that this is the most interesting and exciting day of all, so the number of people attending this part of the festival is larger than for any other activity. After a day of rest, the program starts at eight o'clock sharp. People can wear any kind of clothing. All villagers come to the dancing square. The eldest and the leader ranks take seats in the middle of the dancing circle of young men. The oldest unmarried member of the male work ranks begins. Anyone wishing to announce his intentions in public has to come to the middle of the dancing square to tell everyone what his beloved is especially good at doing- singing, dancing, telling jokes, etc. Only when one of the elders or leaders in front of him says "ALL RIGHT!" does he have the right to pronounce his financee's name. He must say, "My name is..." "I am the son of..." "My sweetheart is..." While he speaks, he must stomp the ground with his right foot with force to convince God that he is serious. "God bless me!" After the crowd has listened, everyone shouts and applauds. The brothers and sisters of the girl whose name has been called come quickly to lift the young man up, praise him, and pour wine into the mouth of their new brother-in-law. The girl's parents bring their beaming daughter to the center and let the pair walk out of the dancing square hand in hand. True love is sublime!

GOING FISHING Pakelagan, the final day, is for gathering with family, friends, and other members of one's rank to relax at the seaside or on the river bank. Everyone then returns to his place of work. We wish each other happiness, health and good furtune for the coming year.

THE ANCESTORS OF AMIS
DOCI ATO CI LALATAN
TWO OLD PEOPLE IN AN AMIS VILLAGE
O TADAMATO ASAY NO PANCAH
Now I wish to tell the story of the ancestors of the Amis. Long, long ago, there was an island called Lagasan in the middle of the big ocean. There was a couple there with two children. The son, named Doci, was fourteen years of age; he had a younger sister called Lalatan. She was not more than two years old. One day it was time for the crops to be harvested. The parents said, "My son, we have no time to attend to the farm over the mountains. You must take good care of your sister and go to our farmhouse on the other side of the hill. After getting there, let the rice harvested yesterday dry by spreading it out on the threshing floor in front of the shelter. The crops were stored near the familiy's canoe. Upon reaching the temporary shelter in the fields, Doci started drying the rice and the millet because the sun was shining brightly. No sooner had he finished drying it than the sky began to blacken. Alas! After the lightning came the thunder, and it started pouring rain. It happened so quickly that all Doci could do was pick up his younger sister and get in the canoe.
Pakogko kako anini ci Doci ato ci Lalatan. Malakakaay cagla tatosa. Na'a yaw, Itira i telog no riyar iraay ko kanatar ci Lagasan hananay.

MILLET AND BETEL NUT
HAFAY ATO 'ICEP NO PANCAH
The whole area was immediately destroyed by the flood. The poor children were frightened. Both of them lost consciousness for several days. When they came to, they found themselves afloat in the sea along with a lot of things including betel nut, breadfruit, and a kind of persimmon. As a result these have been the staples of the Amis people for thousands of years. Doci quickly put as much of these provisions as possible into the canoe, because they had no idea where they were going or how many days they would be at sea.
Namahaen ili, ta'ta'an to ko nanom, mafawfaw to kira tapokpokan, o kiran ili, makilit toway, a ta'ta'agay a 'ogcoy makilit to makala i lotok. Honi sato ili, monafaw to i riyar.

After a time they ran out of the food Doci had brought into the canoe. In order to remain alive, they took turns catching and eating the lice on each other's heads. Thinking they would starve to death, they held each other tightly and fell asleep. As he dreamt, Doci heard the sound of birds singing among trees, and he woke up all of sudden. It seemed too good to be true that they had reached land. He jumped up and went out to search for food on the seashore. How excited he was! He found bananas, pomegranates and other fruits. He took some to feed his hungry little sister. After staying near the seashore for several days, they found their beach inhabited, but they believed that there must be others living somewhere on the island.

When Lalatan had grown up a little, Doci said to her, " We are from the village named Lagasan. It must be near here. Our parents live over there. We must try our best to find the road and go back home tomorrow. Let us go in opposite directions. You are young; your direction is to the south of this place because we came from the south to reach this island. I will take the northern way. If this island is round, we will meet somewhere even if we don't find our parents. Don't be afraid or be upset." "It is all right," said Lalatan.
Sasowalsowal sato safa," o niyaro' Lagasan han ili, i cowaay to, a kilimen ita haw. Mahaen ili, a kilim ita. Matalaw kiso haw?" "caay katalaw." saan ko safa. No mahaen 'i, Ta! A mikilim.

The next morning, after seeing his sister off, Doci set out on his adventure to the north. Many years went by, during which the brother and sister did not meet each other. One day, Doci was looking seaward from the top of a mountain, and saw a person playing on the beach. Hardly believing his eyes, he went there hurriedly to make sure that there was actually another human being living on the island. He was excited to see a pretty girl whose hair had grown very long. They fell in love at first sight.

THE VESSEL OF THE AMIS
RAFAY NO PANCAH
SUPERSTITIONS AND BELEIFS
O KAPAYSINAN NO PAACAH
The Amis have many beliefs and always consider what the gods say to them through birds, dreams, snakes, and the barking of dogs. When they hear something strange, they will do everything with care and ask for help to exorcise bad omens or ill luck. As for dreams, the Amis believe that they carry messages from the gods; a good or bad dream portends a fortunate or unfortunate event for the day to come. For this reason the Amis always consider and review their recent dreams when something serious happens. If, for example, one dreams about drunks or quarreling people, one should be careful the next day. Positive scenes in dreams mean good luck. Also, if one falls asleep and sleeps very well, one will be lucky the next day. Now I will talk about the prognostications of dreams.

AN ORNAMENT OF MEDIUM AND SORCERERESS
FITIG NO INA
If [on a special day] you run across a medium who was once a widow or a sick person, something bad may happen to you that day. You must turn around if you see the medium in front of you; otherwise you need him or her to cure you. For this reason a medium should never visit a place where there is a happy event.
Loma sato a sasowalen, namakayni i madafonohay hananay. Yo madafonohay ili, paysin sa ko Pancah makalitemoh. Magaled kini'an o wawa'ay nika olip a madafonohay haw.

Blackbirds sitting in trees are also omens for the Amis. If you see a bird facing you, it is a good time to go hunting. If its back is turned to you, however, you must be careful in whatever you do on that day.

The Amis also make predictions based on crows. If a crow flies near the house, especially in front of the house, it means that something terrible will happen to the family. That is why the Amis people make noise or throw stones whenever they see a crow flying around the house.

Another sign I want to tell you about is the snake. If you see a snake sleeping when you are going hunting or going to work in the field, this is not a bad omen. If the snake crosses your path, however, this means your hunt will be fruitless, or that you must take great care, lest someone receive an injury.

Another omen I want to mention is the owl. An owl's cry at night signals the birth of a baby in the village. If we hear an owl cry "Gi! Gi!, the mother will have a girl; if it sings "Ko'! Ko', the elders say that we will soon have a new young gentleman among us. If the owls feel uneasy and fight with each other noisily, the couple nearby will quarrel very often and will never have a happy marriage.

Breaking wind in public is considered ill-mannered and is believed to bring bad luck. Breaking wind in the presence of elders will bring punishment upon the offender. There are several other situations in which one should not pass gas: 1. While drying the crops-it means that there will not be a good harvest next year or for a long time. 2. Before entering a barn to take out rice or pile up rice bags. The family will be poor forever. 3. When taking part in special events; this is rude. 4. Whenever an elder is giving a lesson to the younger generation. 5. Before going hunting or catching fish in the river. 6. While a magician practices his or her craft, or while all of the villagers are dancing in public.

If wild geese fly in an unusual formation or cry uncommonly, this a warning that there will be a battle between two tribes. It also means that burglars may do damage to the village. Should geese cry sadly while flying over the house at night, a sick person in the village will die soon.

Seeing a couple making love in the wild is also bad luck. If one happens to witness such an embarassing event, it is best to turn around and walk away quietly. Don't let them know you have seen them.

Sneezing is another action which brings bad luck. Whenever one gets up in the morning and someone is sneezing, one can expect that something bad will happen in the future. People are nervous all day long- who knows what may happen next? One must keep in mind the following prohibitions about sneezing: 1.While elders are making a speech. 2. While elders are praying or worshiping. 3. While a sorcereress is blessing or curing a patient. 4. When one is entering a barn to pile up or get some rice one's family may become poor for good. If you can't help sneezing, just walk away. Never let others know that you are sneezing.

Next I want to talk about the omens of the sun and the wind. If there is a blue cloud around the sun, someone in the village may die. If the cloud looks red, elders say that there might be a typhoon soon. If people hear a sound coming from deep in the ground, there might be an earthquake in the future. When we feel the wind blowing hot and then cold, this is an omen of a savage typhoon. If, while fishing in the river, we catch no fish, it means that there will be an earthquake. If we find the sea near the seashore foggy, this is also an omen of a typhoon. When the longan tree bears plentifully, there will be very strong typhoons that year. Where people eat a turtle and throw out its shell, that's where the eye of the typhoon will hit this year.

"As the elders once have said, they had to built the watch house."
O sowal no mato'asay ho 'i, patireg ko mato' asay to adawag.
"The reason for the elders having built the watch house was that the watch house was the spot to watch or defend against an enemy. That's the way it was."
