President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
Let me put in simple terms why we are apologizing to the indigenous peoples. Four hundred years ago, there were already people living in Taiwan. These first inhabitants lived their lives and had their own languages, cultures, customs, and domains. But then, without their consent, another group of people arrived on these shores, and in the course of history, took everything from the first inhabitants who, on the land they have known most intimately, became displaced, foreign, non-mainstream, and marginalized.
There is a book called "The General History of Taiwan" published in 1920. In its foreword are these words: "Taiwan had no history. The Dutch pioneered it, the Koxinga Kingdom built it, and the Qing Empire managed it." This is a typical Han view of history. The truth is that indigenous peoples have been here for thousands of years, with rich culture and wisdom that have been passed down through generations. But we only know to write history from the perspective of the dominant. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Without the knowledge of the Yami tribe, the government stored nuclear waste on Orchid Island. Tribe members on the island had to suffer the negative consequences. For this, I apologize to the Yami people on behalf of the government.
Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.
After the democratic transition, the country began to respond to the appeals of indigenous movements. The government made certain promises and efforts. Today, we have an Indigenous Peoples Basic Law that is quite advanced. However, government agencies have not given sufficient weight to this law. Our actions have not been fast enough, comprehensive enough or sound enough. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Our efforts have fallen short, and succeeding generations have been blind to this inadequacy. Because of this, your hardship has continued to this day. For this we are truly sorry. Today's apology is long overdue, but it is a beginning. I do not expect any one speech or phrase of apology to wipe away four centuries of pain and suffering by the indigenous peoples. But I do hope with all my heart that today's apology will set this country and all its people on the path towards reconciliation.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
Where modern laws and indigenous traditional cultures are at odds, we will set up an Indigenous Legal Service Center with a high degree of cultural sensitivity, to reduce through institutional design the growing clashes between indigenous customs and modern laws.
At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.
Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.
To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.
I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.
In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.
I call upon all citizens to seize the opportunities offered by this day - to join together, work hard, and build a country of justice, a country of true diversity and equality.
Thank you all

Hello.
My hometown is in Ciwkangan, in Taitung, in Kakacawan.
left home and went to Pingtung to study until I graduated from high school.
I was about to serve in the army.
'You can marry now.'
After I got married, I came to Taipei immediately.
It was around 1974 (when I came) to Taipei.
I have worked there for thirty years.
It is in 1986 that I engaged in the work on Amis.
I was lucky to meet Professor Afan.
'I am going to compile an Amis dictionary,' he said.
He is looking for someone to translate Amis into Chinese.
Therefore I accepted the job then.
From then on, I realized that the Amis language is beautiful.
The speech and the structure of the Amis language are all beautiful.
That was what I thought then.
Only by collecting Amis narratives could we learn about the Amis culture in the past and present.
This way of teaching children is not good enough.
Thus I published a book that year, as teaching materials for children.
Thus I worked on the Amis language up till now.
One day, there was a couple. were old.
came to the field in the mountain to till the field to grow peanuts.
didn't know 'kudasing' was the name of what they were growing.
they were hoeing, a Taiwanese passed by.
'Wow, the old people!' The Taiwanese saw the old couple work hard to grow peanuts.
The Taiwanese, 'How hardworking!'
The old couple, 'Ah, (this is called) Kudasing.'
Peanuts were thus called 'Kudasing'.
'Kulacing' in Taiwanese became the name of peanuts in Amis, 'kudasing'.
The name 'kudasing' is passed down.
There was a child who really liked the dog and the frog.
He really wanted to catch the frog, he put in his urn.
Seeing the frog, he was really happy.
He slept.
He got up in the morning and saw that the frog was gone. He was sad then.
Where was the frog that I put in the urn?
He was so sad that he looked for.
He started to look around, but didn't find it; perhaps went to the mountain.
'Where is it?', he said.
He walked on the road to the mountains.
He looked around and he thought that perhaps was in the hole on the ground.
He called the frog, and it turned out that a vole came out.
He was surprised to see the vole.
The dog was frightened and ran away.
Perhaps was in the hole of the tree, he thought so.
He called the frog; towards the hole of the tree.
He shouted towards the tree hole, but a crow went out.
He was scared and fell down and tumbled onto the ground.
They were really afraid of the crow that he shouted at.
It would be better to stay on the rock.
'I couldn't keep a fast hold on the rock,' he said.
would rather stand up.
He really stood up, seeing a goat.
He felt scared again.
Running away, he didn't know where he went.
He fell into the water and swam there for fear of the goat.
What could he do? He swam to the shore.
He felt relieved because he thought that he could find.
He called, and the frog also called him.
He kept looking and called the frog.
There were many children.
Or his friends? He felt relieved.
My description is like this.
There was a child, at night (he stayed with) his partner and friend, a dog and a frog.
He put the frog in his bottle, because the frog was his most cherished friend.
The dog made a thorough search, but didn't find the frog.
The child searched his house for the frog, but didn't find it.
The dog accidentally put its head into the bottle to search the bottle (for the frog), and his head entered the bottle. The dog and the child kept calling.
They looked for the frog.
The dog was not careful and fell down. Afterwards, the bottle was broken.
The child took the dog and held it in the arms.
The child kept calling his frog, but didn't find it.
There were bees flying in front of them at a distance.
The dog kept jumping and wanted to catch the bees.
There was a beehive in front of them.
The dog was there. When the dog saw the bees, it wanted to climb up and shook the tree.
The child kept shouting towards the hole.
searched the hole, but the frog was not there; a mouse went out instead.
He thought that perhaps my frog was inside the tree hole.
He stretched out his hand to see (if the frog was inside), but it turned out that what came out was an owl.
The owl came out.
After the dog shook the tree, all the bees came out and chased the dog, so the dog kept running.
After the owl came out, the child was scared and hid himself.
ran away, ignoring the dog and the child.
But the child wanted to look for the frog. climbed up a rock.
He held on to the tree, but the tree turned out to be a deer.
What went out was a deer.
He climbed onto the deer, so the deer kept running.
He didn't care about the dog and the deer.
The child and the dog fell into the stream.
After they fell into the stream, and after a long time, the child heard the frog's sound.
The child said to the dog, 'Don't speak. Our friend, the frog, might be here.'
He saw that the frog had many friends there.
'"Ah, my frog was here," he thought,' I said.
The frog leapt towards them.
Then he told the frog's friends, 'We are going home.'
'The frog is my friend,' said he.
'Take care,' he said to the frogs.
What happened to the rice last time you went to the farm?
I only picked the snap beans under the peach trees.
Because of the frequent rain, probably the rice is not good. I think so.
What do you think after seeing the rice? That's what I think.
Well, what can I do? The weather is like this.
This is how the weather changes. This is the only way.
Maybe in June.
It is time to harvest, I think.
We should arrange the stuff for harvest, like sacks.
Take them out, I think.
What if we store it at the farmers' association?
I am asking for your opinion.
I think it doesn't matter. Everywhere is the same to me.
If you say so, okay.
To sum up, wouldn't it be better if at the farmers' association?
We don't have to carry them around, I think so.
As for my rice, I won't store it at the farmer's association.
Well, that's okay, if that's what you think.
I don't know how to change your mind.
That won't be tiring when you get the food, if that's what you think.
The peaches that grow....
Did you go and take a look?
I saw that they were all red.
They were all rotten; the rest were infested with worms.
I didn't manage to deal with it.
We didn't spray pesticides, so the worms grew.
I went to Takuliaw yesterday to check.
The peaches this year are not really good. So many worms.
Well, we didn't spray pesticides, so his fruits are not good.
I picked some yesterday.
The good ones were less than ten.
Did you throw them away?
I didn't bring them back here.
later, when we go to carry the concrete.
The grapes sprouted.
I took a piece of black cloth to cover the plant.
We can do it this way. As a net, I think.
There is a net at home.
If Lekal didn't take it, we'll use it as a shed for the grapes. That's what I think.
Below Kasapad's.
I have sent money to Kuo Chintien, half of it.
A few days later when the title deed is done, I will pay the balance.
We will probably come back then.
In which month are they coming back?
This month.
This June?
Right, this June, or probably May.
So last time you mentioned that Mayaw already bought that piece of land.
We are going to spray pesticides. That is what you said.
When the weather is good, we'll go there to spray pesticides. That's what I think.
If you do not have time, we will not force you. Your child will be angry.
There is nothing to do. We will go there to spray pesticides.
Did all your children come home?
they didn't. They are all married and returned to the hometown of their spouse in the south.
To the home of their spouse. T: Oh, didn't come home? P: Yesterday, they visited, left.
They would probably come tomorrow night. T: Oh, have you finished (cleaning up your ancestors') tombs?
Not yet, we're still cleaning. A few days ago we cleaned Mother's and Father's tombs.
The cement cracked and so water leaked inside.
Right, ours also cracked.
We have started to work a few days ago.
We should be able to finish today. Once we are done, we will kill a pig.
Good!
Have you finished this morning?
We would finish today.
We already killed a pig this morning.
That's good.
Aciang and Namuh bought the pig.
Ofad invited them there.
Just now? P: Right!
So going there for dinner later?
The children don't have time to come home.
Nufu (and his family) just came from Taitung.
Didn't Hekaw come home?
didn't come home; they didn't have time.
Aren't you tired doing this?
That's good.
But I can't explain in Chinese.
If there is something I don't know, lots of repetitions, right?
Me too.
There are some that I know.
And had the answer.
They found an answer by themselves.
I wouls day, 'Right, like that'.
That's good! P: Yes, but it's easier this time.
Not like the two, when I just started, this (collecting data) is easy.
Even though cannot find an answer, regardless of how much you know, can express it.
If the expression is close, I do it like this, but I'm not able to help with the others.
Yes.
If there is an easier part, it's just like this.
They come here to learn.
They want to learn Amis; otherwise, they want to do research.
They do research. T: I think so.
Why is there an 'a'?
Why is there an 'i'?
They do research.
Right, if they want to learn, they have to practice many times. P: Yes, they (are here to) do research.
If there is an 'i', if there is a 'ka', if the order of 'ku' is reversed, it does not sound correct.
It's not good.
It's not good.
There was a farmer.
climbed up a tree to pick fruits.
He put the fruits he plucked into a bag in front of him.
Then he went down. He unpacked the fruits, and put them into a basket.
Then, he put the guavas that he plucked into the basket.
He climbed up again to pluck fruits.
He put them in the front.
However, there was a shepherd who passed the person who was plucking fruits.
He was plucking fruits.
There was a child who was riding a bicycle.
He saw the worker, who was plucking.
He took one basket.
Then he put it onto the bicycle.
He left.
He stole a basket of fruits, that is, guavas.
That child, riding a bicycle, tripped over a stone and fell.
Three children helped that child load the basket.
He loaded the basket.
The child left.
However, halfway, his friends whistled.
He forgot the hat.
His friends, those three children, returned the hat to the child, who stole the fruits.
He gave each person a fruit.
Then, they left the child who rode a bicycle and stole the fruits.
Those three children came to where the elder was plucking fruits.
He saw the three children, who were eating.
He plucked fruits the second time and went down, "How come one basket of fruits is gone?"
I am going to tell about my life.
My father and mother named me Tamih.
My mother and father, who gave birth to me, said 'you were born when we moved to this village.'
Now, I am 81 years old.
I am almost 82 years old.
I went to Chang-bin Elementary School here.
After I graduated from elementary school, the elders said, 'no one could take care of the cows.'
Thus, I stayed at home to take care of the cows.
But there were not enough people to help the elders; thus I became their helper.
When I grew up, there was a war between Japan and the US then.
If there were US planes, I would notify all the soldiers.
I stayed there for four years until the war was over.
Then I helped the elders with their work.
My job was farming.
After the war of Japan was over, someone came to preach the words of God, to preach Christianity.
I was amazed by the preacher.
During those two years, the preachers kept coming.
My mind was enlightened.
I firmly believed in it.
From then on, a preacher called me to invite me to become a preacher.
If you want to study, you can study and become a preacher.
I was eager (to be a preacher).
There was a shortage of workers at the farm, my father and mother grudgingly agreed.
Then I studied.
After I graduated, there were many disciples.
I became a teacher here, preaching.
Not only here, I also went to Changbin and the port.
I kept preaching the words of God.
There weren't many preachers at that time.
I on my own, or with Fodo' sometimes.
There were more and more afterwards.
Four years after we built the church, Turis, who was from the States, came here to learn Amis.
After he heard what I taught him, he found that it was different from what Urok and Tuana spoke.
He grabbed hold of me.
Let us translate the Bible.
From then on, I started to accompany him.
At that time there was no written Amis, so there was no Amis Bible.
After Turis came, I accompanied.
Then we had written Amis.
(The written Amis) spread.
we used Zhuyin symbols to transcribe Amis words.
We learned Amis that way.
From then on until I was 65, I took on the task of translating the Bible.
Turis returned to the States, there was a new preacher, Afan.
Turis entrusted the task of Bible translation to Afan.
Afan and I translated the Bible together.
In retrospect, I spent thirty years developing a writing system for Amis.
I thought if Turis hadn't come, or if I had not liked his company, we would not have developed a writing system for Amis.
I felt gratified.
It is good that many people read the Bible.
Our speech was unified as we had a writing system.
At the time when there was no writing system of Amis, the Amis spoken in the south was different from that spoken in the central area.
Changbin is located in the middle.
Our speech was unified after we had an Amis Bible.
Both the north and south areas adopted the unified speech.
The Amis language was unified as there was a writing system.
We thank God for guiding us; that's what I think.
I did not receive higher education because I only attended elementary school.
Now I have retired.
I have been working for the church for fifty years, leading the church.
At that time I was resting; now I'm still resting.
Although I have retired, I still help small churches here like those in Yongfu and Takumi.
I go to both churches in turn to help.
As long as I'm not dead yet, why would I stop doing what I like?
Now I'm alone.
My children are all grown-up; I have five children.
Two daughters and three sons.
They have good jobs.
I am satisfied.
Although I live alone at home, they would return to visit me and accompany me.
My second daughter is teaching at Changbin Elementary School.
She lives here to accompany me.
I have now told you about the journey of my life.
There was an elder coming to the mountain.
He climbed up a tree and plucked guavas.
His bag was full.
He went down and put the fruits in the basket.
There was a child who rode a bike. He passed the tree.
The elder didn't see that the child took a basket that was full of fruits and that he put them on his bike and carried them away.
Then, he left.
Halfway, the child met a girl who rode a bike.
The boy who rode a bike fell, and what he took were scattered.
The fruits were scattered, so he put them on the bike.
There were three children, and they helped the child.
They helped the child put the fruits in the basket.
After it is done, he got up and went home.
The elder went down and saw that one basket was gone.
'Who took it?', he said.
There were three children passing by, and they were holding and eating the fruits.
The elder saw this, wondering whether they took.
That's it.
Yes, Ciwkangan is our tribe.
Af for the so-called Ciwkangan Tribe, in the past, would never disobey the chief.
If there was a plague, if people needed to re-cultivate the land, the chief would assign the work to people.
This was also true of praying for rain and the sun.
There were many taboos in the tribe.
People couldn't work then.
The society and women's association would assemble.
From the life of Amis, what the younger generations see and keep abreast of.
Alas, the offsprings are industrious.
The chief worked hard for the tribal matters.
There are no subsidies from the government now.
The youths worked hard in the tribe, logging and picking vines.
For example, gathering woods and looking for to kill.
That's how the tribe was in the past.
Why was the work smooth?
Why was the thing smooth on that day?
we had been prepared.
The chief and the youths had made proper arrangements.
Everything was arranged so the work was smooth.
The thing was done.
That's it.
We know nothing about the ancestors' God.
The ritual (by the wizard) means the start of the preparation for worship and other relevant activities.
During the worship, all the clans would be united.
There are many clans in Ciwkangan.
Each clan would worship.
That's it.
Now, if someone is sick and is to be cast a spell on, people would kill pigs to worship God.
That's it.
If someone is sick, there are wizards in Ciwkangan.
If someone is sick, he would be invited and a spell would be cast on him/her..
To cast a spell.
If s/he can be cured, s/he would recover.
If s/he is lucky, s/he is lucky.
The ancestors were like this.
All the clans were united.
That's it.
The society would be mobilized.
The chiefs (of the clans) would assemble.
The youths would come to Xiuguluan River, here at Makuta'ay, the so-called Moon Well.
There is the so-called Moon Well below; pray for rain there.
If they were lucky, it would rain.
The past is like this.
If many people in the tribe were sick or had a fever, or any disease, the fathers of the youths would be called.
We carried out epidemic prevention.
The youths picked Aledu (some kind of plant).
Spells were casting from door to door.
The corners of every house were tapped.
To expel the demons, the so-called 'akuma'.
As for what the elders mean by 'kalalakw' is to build houses.
Planning the houses for those would like to divide up family property.
If people want to pick vines, they have to set out today and stay overnight at Cifutingay.
They came back on the second day.
The elders then processed the vines.
After it was done, it is sufficient to build a house, built a house.
The youths built houses.
People would not build houses on their own.
Everything depends on money now.
That is what I want to say about the past.
We farmers are really hard-working.
There was a person who went to the mountain.
He grew many guavas in the mountain, so he got up and went to pluck guavas.
When he arrived, only one tree (what he planted) was fruitful, and he felt satisfied.
He took a ladder to pluck guavas.
He saw that two baskets were filled with the guavas that he plucked.
Then, a person who pulled a goat along passed.
But the person who sold goats was not greedy.
He saw the fruit, the guavas; the person who pulled the goat along passed and saw.
Before long, there was a child that rode a bike.
Really, the child has not grown up; he passed there.
He looked at what the farmer plucked and saw two baskets were full of guavas.
He took one basket and put it on his bike, and then he rode his bike away.
He was really greedy.
The child took home, and was really afraid; he met other people and was really afraid.
The bike hit a rock so he fell; this was because he was afraid.
He took the farmer's guavas, so he was afraid.
But there were three people, they saw the child fall down.
After putting the guavas in the basket, he helped him put the basket on his bike.
Then they walked away separately, and halfway, he saw the child's hat at where the child fell. He went back to gave the hat to the child.
Those three people were really kind.
The three people passed where the farmer plucked fruit and saw the old man's work. They saw and said 'Wow, so many!' and then went past.
The farmer looked and went down.
He was plucking above; he didn't know that one basket had been stolen.
So he went down, and saw one basket was gone. The farmer was sad.
'I put two baskets.'
'How come only one basket was full?'
At that time, the farmer was sad.
The farmer was like this: he was sad and industrious.
His work was pick fruits.
His fruits were plenty.
He prepared three baskets for holding the fruits, so he went to the farmland to pick.
He climbed up the ladder to pick fruits.
He put in that he had prepared to hold the fruits.
His toil of picking fruits is reminiscent of our toil as farmers, like the farmers in our village.
Before long, he finished picking the fruits, he put them in his basket.
So he climbed up the tree again to pick fruits.
He was picking fruits.
There was a man pulling a goat along; passed the tree where he picked fruits.
When he was picking fruits, the goat looked around and wanted to eat the fruits.
The goat passed the tree where picked fruits.
There was a child riding a bike; passed the tree where he picked fruits.
The child saw the fruits and wanted to take them.
He put his bike by the side.
He looked at the farmer, (but the farmer) didn't see him.
wanted to steal one and looked around.
The farmer didn't see him.
He took one basket and hung it on his bike, leaving quickly.
He left delightedly.
He saw a young girl ahead. He saw (her and thought she was) beautiful.
He looked around and turned round to see, falling from his bike halfway.
After he fell down, all the fruits fell off.
He looked at his foot, which was bleeding.
He looked up. There were three children helping him pick up the fruits.
'Ah, the three children helped me,' he thought.
After he was done, he helped the three children put the basket on.
He saw the three children go by.
The hat fell onto the ground, and one of the children picked it up.
He blew and turned around to see, returning the hat to the rider.
The child who stole the fruits thought, 'Ah, the children were so kind.'
He gave some fruits to the three children, and each had one fruit.
Then, the children left.
Then, the old person, the farmer thought, ' (the baskets) are full.I could come down,' he thought.
He looked at his baskets, only two left.
Only one was full.
He looked around, the three friends/children went by eating fruits.
The old man was looking at the three children, thinking, 'Is it these three people (that stole my fruits)?'
The three children went by.
I'm done with my story.
My name is Panay.
I was born in Ciwkangan.
I went to school here in Kakacawan for six years.
graduated here.
I worked with the elders and learned farming.
I grew up and got married.
I have three children; all are female.
I have five grandchildren.
Now, my job is to take care of elders.
Home care is my present profession.
My life has been like that up to now.
There was a person who was plucking fruit.
Then, a child gathered the fruits and put them on the bike.
He rode home.
On his way, another bike hit the child.
He fell down, and then the fruits were scattered all over.
At that time, he met three people, who raised him to his feet.
The three people helped him put on the bike.
Then, he walked.
He walked smoothly.
I will tell a story about a child.
There was a child.
He looked at it everyday.
When it was time to sleep at night and he was asleep, the frog left stealthily.
When he woke up, he looked at the bottle.
He didn't see the frog which he put in the bottle.
He looked for the net that he used to catch that frog.
The dog looked at where the frog was kept.
He didn't see. outside.
Looking for, the dog fell head over heels from the window of the house.
Then, the child took the dog outside to look (for the frog).
They arrived at a forest.
Many bees were flying.
'What is this?' they thought.
As they came closer, they saw a beehive.
The dog looked at (the beehive), barked, and climb (up the tree).
The beehive fell down.
The child peeked into a hole, thinking that the frog was hiding inside there.
A mouse appeared.
He went back and climbed up the tree.
The frog was not there.
An owl suddenly appeared and frightened him.
He fell down from the tree.
The dog heard him fall.
barked at the bees.
The child hid behind the rocks.
The dog hid among the rocks.
The owl was looking at it.
He held on to what he thought was a piece of wood.
At that moment, the deer carried it to the cliff of the mountains.
At the cliff of the mountain, the deer flung the child.
After they reached the bank, they took a rest.
They saw two frogs here.
" didn't go anywhere," they thought.
They felt very happy.
There was an old man going to the river to look for something to cook and eat.
He got to the river.
He flipped over a stone.
He found an insect.
He didn't know the name of the insect.
I want to talk about why crabs are called 'Kalang.'
This is what I want to talk about.
An old man went to the river.
He found an insect.
He didn't know what it was.
He found an insect.
The Taiwanese saw the old man. His hand was bitten.
'Kalang' in Taiwanese means 'to bite.'
So we Amis call it Kalang.
This is why we call crabs Kalang.
There was a child facing the frog he caught, putting in a bottle
The frog left.
'Where is my frog?' The child looked for.
Because there was a dog, and therefore the bottle where the child put the frog toppled.
'What happened to my frog?'
He searched and called. 'Where is my frog?'
'Why did you play with the bottle where I put the frog?' The child scolded the dog.
'Where is my frog?' He called and searched.
He went to the forest and searched the hole.
'Where is my frog?'
'Is it inside this hole?' he said so and called.
'Where is my frog?' He said so and called.
Then he came here.
He was sad.
He searched there, only to find nothing.
The dog was jumping, playing with something hung above.
He was still calling, 'My frog!'
'My frog!' he said so.
He kept looking for his frog.
At this point, he went to the forest to look for the frog.
He fell when he was searching, falling down from the tree.
The child lay on the ground.
Here came an eagle, which wanted to dive towards him.
He was afraid.
He went up onto the rock and called.
'My frog, where are you?' he said so, searching.
He saw a deer there.
He ran and searched, afraid of this deer.
He fell into the water. He was drowning.
But the dog rescued him.
Here, he carried the dog on his head in the water.
He didn't give up. He wanted to find the frog.
He was still looking for his frog.
At this point, he saw the frog and his dog on the rock.
There were many frogs below.
'Which one is mine,' said he.
One of them was his frog.
He was glad to see the frog.
There was a person planting a tree, which bore six pears.
He plucked pears.
He climbed up. The tree grew tall.
He climbed up. He climbed up with a ladder.
What he plucked were numerous.
Two baskets were full.
He climbed up again to pluck up there.
There was a person who pulled a goat along.
He went and approached, seeing the plucked pears. He put them back.
After a while, there was a child who rode a bike and passed by.
He saw a person plucking above.
He raised his head, and that person (the person who was plucking fruit) did not look down.
He took one basket and put it on his bike.
He couldn't do anything. He was plucking above.
The boy who rode a bike took one basket.
Somewhere not far away, he met one girl who rode a bike.
When they met, the wind blew the boy's hat away.
His hat was going to fall down soon, so he grasped it.
Even though he tried hard, his hat still fell down.
He could not look at the front attentively.
There was a stone in the front, and the bike hit the stone.
The child fell down.
His foot hurt.
The pears in the basket were scattered all over when he fell down.
He stroked his foot.
The child could not get up.
The three children passed the person who plucked fruit and they carried balls.
He helped pick up the pears and put them in the basket.
The child who fell down got up.
The three helped him put onto his bike.
Then, the child left and went home.
The three went towards their destination.
They went past the road where the person was plucking pears.
He saw only one basket was filled with pears, and one basket was not full.
Where was one basket? He kept thinking.
He found the three people who passed nothing.
They passed, carrying balls.
That person shook his head. His head was lopsided, looking at the basket which not was filled with pears.
The men of the Amis worked on the farm or went hunting during the daytime, and only the women and children stayed home. Sometimes they grew rice and sweet potatoes. If they went to work on the hillside, the children would follow or accompany them. The elder brothers or sisters took care of the younger ones near the field so the mothers could easily feed their babies when they cried. One day, when a mother wanted to feed her baby, the elder children said, "Hey Mom! you've fed the baby already. Is it necessary to wake it up again?" "Oh! When did I come to feed the baby? I have not touched it since I left it this morning," answered the astonished mother. They hurried to look at the baby, and were very distressed to find that the baby had been dead for quite some time. Its body was cold. Afterward the mother examined the child and found that there was something wrong with its stomach; it seemed so thin. She went nearly mad with grief because of her child's death. When she got home, she heard that the same thing had happened in every family that had a newborn baby. In every village, there were lots of babies killed in the same way.
The clan held a meeting to figure out what had happened to the children, and to discover who had killed them. The magician of the village performed an autopsy on the dead babies and found that all of babies had no liver or small intestine. Everyone was very depressed, and tried to figure out who might have killed their children. One said, "It must be the newcomers, the Alikakay. Since they came to live near us, there is always something strange happening in our village. I have never seen them work on the farm or plant anything. How do they make their living? Recently, they have all disappeared. Where are they?
CHOOSING AND SEPERATING THE FISH, GIVING BIG ONES TO THE ELDER RANKS
At last it was agreed that the different villages ruined by the Alikakay had to unite; only by joining forces in battle with the Alikakay could they win. Marang Bawbaw was elected to be the general of all villages. He took charge of everything in the fight with the Alikakay. Marang Bawbaw announced, "Our enemy, the Alikakay, seem strange. If we want to overthrow them, the best way is for the strongest young men in every village to be selected according to their prowess in nine events: the Malenlen (long-distance running], Pafenfeng [throwing stones at a target], Mafekac [100m race], Mipana' [throwing the javelin], Mahahawang [hand-to-hand fighting], Milalefok [wrestling], and Mipatekal [pole-vaulting]. After the young men are selected, I will train them for half a year to a year or more. Then will drive the Alikakay from our land." All agreed.
A TEMPORARY SHELTER FOR USE IN THE FIELDS OR MOUNTAINS
The general Marang Bawbaw felt dejected and sorrowful because he was unable to do anything to conquer the Alikakay. He rested on a flat rock near the seashore, and soon fell asleep. He dreamed of the Kapit, the sea god. The god told him the secret by which he could defeat the Alikakay. The Amis must use the Polog, a long grass, tying the leaves in knots and hanging them on the front door to exorcise evil spirits. That night Marang Bawbaw assigned some volunteers, very deliberate men, to hang the Polog on the house of each Alikakay family. The next morning the sorcerers and Marang Bawbaw held a sacrificial rite to worship Heaven, the sea god, and their ancestors, asking them to bless all the Amis. After the rite, they found all of the Alikakay sick and frail. Soon their leader came to beseech the Amis for mercy. The Amis were so kind that they agreed to forgive them if they would go away immediately. All the Alikakay walked toward the sea and disappeared out of sight of the Amis. Later all the Amis heard the Alikakay say, "In appreciation for your not punishing us for our past misdeeds, we ask of you only that you offer us three things-betel nut, wine, and glutinous rice cakes- near the sea or near a river every year in June. Then, you will catch a lot of fish. From that time onward, the Alikakay never appeared again. This is the reason reason why the Amis, celebrate the Ilsin Mila'edis in June or early July. After the event, the Amis found that all the young men who had been trained in the mountains were healthy and strong. This practice has been followed ever since. Indeed, the Amis are obliged to follow it forever.

FEAST FOR ANCESTORS
In the village of Lidaw, near Hualien City, people hold a big celebration for their ancestors every two years. During the party, mediums, sorceresses and sorcerers contact the ancestors and ask them to bless every member of the village and give them happiness and health. This ceremony now is always performed by the leader of the mediums, known as the Kamaya. She guides the other mediums in the proper execution of this rite, whose purpose is to bring prosperity to the village for years to come.

Why is it that the Amis still have no written language? I will tell the story of why the Amis language lacks writing. Originally, before the arrival of the Kaagatay ["the invaders," i.e., the chinese], Taiwan was inhabited by the Amis people. When these foreigners came to Taiwan, they saw that the Amis were clever, but that they had no writing system. The Kaagatay said, "Let us both invent a writing system [so that we can communicate with each other]. We will agree to use the better of the two systems." Having made this agreement, the Amis wrote their alphabet on stone, while the Kaagatay wrote theirs on white cork. Then the Kaagatay said, "Throw your masterpiece into the water, and we will throw in our cork. The one that floats will be the one which we use. We will learn it well. What a cunning people they are! After the deal was made, they both threw their works into the Hsiukuluan River. What a pity it was! The stone with our writing sank, while the cork of the Kaagatay floated. For this reason the writing of the Kaagatay has been used since that time. This is also the reason why they claim to be the first inhabitants and the leaders of this island. They forced the Amis to agree to accept their language by saying that because it floated it was better than the writing system of the Amis. Thus it is that our Amis writing system no longer exists.

THE HIGHEST MALE WORK RANKS
The groups which actually participate in communal work are the Teloc to Tatelongan; the others just stay in the public house and wait, though sometimes lending a hand if necessary. What kind of work do they do? Everything. They are trained how to serve others. Ordinarily, they take resposibility for protecting the village against enemies. During special events, like the Harvest Festival, they are the main force in making all necessary arrangements. All important decisions are made by the elder groups after conferring with others. If they can't come to an agreement, they will turn to the Tomok [chief] of the village. His suggestions are discussed in making a final decision. The youngest rank, the Teloc, have seven duties: 1. Normal protection of the village. 2. Taking charge of village ceremonies. 3. Dealing with emergencies and helping anyone who needs a hand. 4. Teaching the younger generation proper manners and respect for the elderly. 5. Apprehending burglars and criminals. 6. Carrying out the commands of the elders, especially in matters of communal importance. 7. Hunting, burning off the forest, and building roads for the village.
THE TELOC DANCE- THE YOUNGEST MALE WORK RANKS
The busiest time for them is from April to September, In April, they begin practicing all the dances and songs for the harvest festival. Another task is to repair or rebuild the watchhouse or meeting houses of the village, and to construct new roads or paths. June is the season for Mila'edis, catching fish. July, August and September are the most important months for the Amis; during this time they give thanks to the the gods for giving them another harvest year.
THE LOWEST RANK DANCE BRAVELY AND ENGETICALLY
BAG FOR CARRYING FISH
Drawing divisions in Amis work ranks is quite different from that of forming troops. The first division is determined according to age. The names of these division are, respectively: Misatataay, Midodo'ay, Paafagay, Kedohan, Mirokrokay, Papetohan, and Spaliloc. The names of the divisions sometimes vary from village to village.
If there is a battle between two tribes or two villages, the rank of the Papedohan is the main force; the last rank is the Sapaliloc, whose main mission in battle is to take care of the wounded. The Sapililoc are regarded as an auspicious force because of their youth and energy-their presence means hope for the future of the tribe. The Mirokrokay are the warriors; their duty is to attack and defeat the enemy. Regardless of their position, all members of the Amis sale work ranks are bound to the regulations which apply to their rank. It is this discipline and unity which makes the Amis a strong group.
THE ELDER TEACH THE YOUNG TO MAKE BOWLS
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL IN SAANIWAN
In Saaniwan, the Harvest Festival lasts for seven days. Before the event, the young people spend one day fishing in the main river near the village. This is called Pifotigan, which means "the day for fishing." Another day of preparation for the festival is spent cooking traditional foods, including sticky rice bread. This second day is called Pisafelacan. The night of the the second day is called Ka'ifolodan. This is when the real activities start. The names of the days of the festival are: SARAKAT PAKOMODAN, SAKATOSA PAKOMODAN, SAKATOLO PAKOMODAN, SAKASEPAT PAKOMODAN, SAKALIMA PAKOMODAN, PAGAYATAN NO KAPAH, PIPIHAYAN. On the last day we have an activity called Pakelag, which means relaxing with one's own family and friends on the river bank or seashore. Now let me tell you all in detail.
HEADBAND AND NECKLACES
THE DAYS OF THE HARVEST FESTIVAL ARE THE HAPPIEST TIME FOR ALL CHILDREN IN AMIS VILLAGES
The distribution of work for the ceremonies depends on the number of the young people in the village. Each rank has its special name in accordance with this great event. The names are: LAKOKAY, LATIFO, LAHALAC, LA'ALAPO, LATINGWA, and PAKALONGAY. The responsibilities of each rank during the fishing work are as follows: 1. The Lakokay, the chief of the youth, lead the other ranks in carrying out missions. 2.The Latifo sprinkle the wild walnut, a poisonous plant, on the surface of the river. 3. The Lahalac are responsible for the behavior of the youth: Who is lazy? Who steals fish? 4. The La'alapo take responsibility for picking the fish up and gathering them into the baskets. 5. The Latingwa carry the fish traps or fish baskets. 6. The Pakalogay, the lowest rank, do whatever the elder ranks ask. Any man whose wife is expecting must not go along with the ranks to fish. If he does, the poison may lose its effectiveness in paralyzing the fish.

TEACHING EVERYONE ABOUT OUR HISTORY: Just as those before us, we worship our ancestors. If women participate, the men must dance with them, or they will not be able to dance and sing earnestly, for fear that someone in the village might die. The oldest man in the village tells people the history of the Saaniwan and the location of the village.

THE FIRST DAY OF THE CEREMONY The dancing and singing on this day are quite different from those of the previous night. Today, the day known as Salakat Pakomodan, there are many girls, young women, and mothers with children who join the dancing circle at the end. There is also a fire in the middle of the dancing square. All the villagers must take part in the activities today. Each dancer wears the traditional dress appropriate to his rank. On this day everyone has fun, because each person plays an important role in the ceremony and learns how to cooperate and get along with others.
MASS AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL Since all the villagers are Catholics, everyone must attend mass in the morning. Each one must put on traditional costumes, priests and nuns included, because the dancing begins immediately after the mass. We worship our ancestors by attending the mass, and also invite them to share what we have after the ceremony, as a sign of appreciation to them.
PRAISE GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD DEEDS OF THE VILLAGE THIS YEAR
THE FEAST FOR THE ELDERS In order to show the long and proud tradition of the Amis, the youth on this day prepare a big feast for older people. A long time ago, the youth went hunting and brought meat to serve the old. Now that the environment doesn't allow us to hunt any more, the young people just collect money from all the ranks and prepare a sumptuous meal. After the meal, they put on performances to entertain the elders. Then all the villagers dance the Pa'inonoran. No one can lead the dance without special experience in impromptu singing and dancing. Should someone dare attempt it, then he or she would be upbraided for bringing bad luck upon the entire village.
THE SASH BELT OF THE PAKALOGAY
THE DIPLOMATIC FEAST The activity held on this evening might be called a diplomatic feast. The villagers invite all the outsiders who have helped the village-construction workers, government leaders, etc.-to join them in a feast. After the lunch, the guests are invited to take part in the dancing and singing.
CHURCH FATHERS, POLICE OFFICERS, THE LEADERS OF OTHER NEIGHBORING VILLAGERS AND OTHERS ARE INVITED.
MATCHING NIGHT When the activities of the Harvest Festival for all villages are almost over, people may choose to take part in whatever activities they want. For the young men, especially those who are unmarried, this day's Pagalatan to Kapah is a very important and practical event, for this is the time that he determines whether the siblings and parents of his beloved will agree to marriage or not. This day also provides entertainment to help release the tensions of the past several days of Harvest Festival activities. Most people feel that this is the most interesting and exciting day of all, so the number of people attending this part of the festival is larger than for any other activity. After a day of rest, the program starts at eight o'clock sharp. People can wear any kind of clothing. All villagers come to the dancing square. The eldest and the leader ranks take seats in the middle of the dancing circle of young men. The oldest unmarried member of the male work ranks begins. Anyone wishing to announce his intentions in public has to come to the middle of the dancing square to tell everyone what his beloved is especially good at doing- singing, dancing, telling jokes, etc. Only when one of the elders or leaders in front of him says "ALL RIGHT!" does he have the right to pronounce his financee's name. He must say, "My name is..." "I am the son of..." "My sweetheart is..." While he speaks, he must stomp the ground with his right foot with force to convince God that he is serious. "God bless me!" After the crowd has listened, everyone shouts and applauds. The brothers and sisters of the girl whose name has been called come quickly to lift the young man up, praise him, and pour wine into the mouth of their new brother-in-law. The girl's parents bring their beaming daughter to the center and let the pair walk out of the dancing square hand in hand. True love is sublime!
YOUNG MEN MAY DANCE WITH THEIR SWEETHEARTS
THE THINGS CARRIED ON WEDDING DAYS IN AMIS VILLAGES
FAREWELL FOR SPIRITS AND ANCESTORS The women of the village handle the Pipihayan, a great farewell party to respectfully send off the spirits and souls of the ancestors, and request their company at the same time next year. Dancing on this day is different from that of any other day.
GOING FISHING Pakelagan, the final day, is for gathering with family, friends, and other members of one's rank to relax at the seaside or on the river bank. Everyone then returns to his place of work. We wish each other happiness, health and good furtune for the coming year.
THE ENTIRE FAMILY GOES FISHING IN THE RIVER WITH CLOSE FRIENDS
THE ANCESTORS OF AMIS
TWO OLD PEOPLE IN AN AMIS VILLAGE
Now I wish to tell the story of the ancestors of the Amis. Long, long ago, there was an island called Lagasan in the middle of the big ocean. There was a couple there with two children. The son, named Doci, was fourteen years of age; he had a younger sister called Lalatan. She was not more than two years old. One day it was time for the crops to be harvested. The parents said, "My son, we have no time to attend to the farm over the mountains. You must take good care of your sister and go to our farmhouse on the other side of the hill. After getting there, let the rice harvested yesterday dry by spreading it out on the threshing floor in front of the shelter. The crops were stored near the familiy's canoe. Upon reaching the temporary shelter in the fields, Doci started drying the rice and the millet because the sun was shining brightly. No sooner had he finished drying it than the sky began to blacken. Alas! After the lightning came the thunder, and it started pouring rain. It happened so quickly that all Doci could do was pick up his younger sister and get in the canoe.
MILLET AND BETEL NUT
The whole area was immediately destroyed by the flood. The poor children were frightened. Both of them lost consciousness for several days. When they came to, they found themselves afloat in the sea along with a lot of things including betel nut, breadfruit, and a kind of persimmon. As a result these have been the staples of the Amis people for thousands of years. Doci quickly put as much of these provisions as possible into the canoe, because they had no idea where they were going or how many days they would be at sea.
After a time they ran out of the food Doci had brought into the canoe. In order to remain alive, they took turns catching and eating the lice on each other's heads. Thinking they would starve to death, they held each other tightly and fell asleep. As he dreamt, Doci heard the sound of birds singing among trees, and he woke up all of sudden. It seemed too good to be true that they had reached land. He jumped up and went out to search for food on the seashore. How excited he was! He found bananas, pomegranates and other fruits. He took some to feed his hungry little sister. After staying near the seashore for several days, they found their beach inhabited, but they believed that there must be others living somewhere on the island.
When Lalatan had grown up a little, Doci said to her, " We are from the village named Lagasan. It must be near here. Our parents live over there. We must try our best to find the road and go back home tomorrow. Let us go in opposite directions. You are young; your direction is to the south of this place because we came from the south to reach this island. I will take the northern way. If this island is round, we will meet somewhere even if we don't find our parents. Don't be afraid or be upset." "It is all right," said Lalatan.
The next morning, after seeing his sister off, Doci set out on his adventure to the north. Many years went by, during which the brother and sister did not meet each other. One day, Doci was looking seaward from the top of a mountain, and saw a person playing on the beach. Hardly believing his eyes, he went there hurriedly to make sure that there was actually another human being living on the island. He was excited to see a pretty girl whose hair had grown very long. They fell in love at first sight.
THE VESSEL OF THE AMIS
SUPERSTITIONS AND BELEIFS
The Amis have many beliefs and always consider what the gods say to them through birds, dreams, snakes, and the barking of dogs. When they hear something strange, they will do everything with care and ask for help to exorcise bad omens or ill luck. As for dreams, the Amis believe that they carry messages from the gods; a good or bad dream portends a fortunate or unfortunate event for the day to come. For this reason the Amis always consider and review their recent dreams when something serious happens. If, for example, one dreams about drunks or quarreling people, one should be careful the next day. Positive scenes in dreams mean good luck. Also, if one falls asleep and sleeps very well, one will be lucky the next day. Now I will talk about the prognostications of dreams.
1: You find a clear spring at night, and everyone there takes off their clothes to bathe in it. This dream tells us that whomever we see in the dream who is sick will be well very soon, even if he or she is seriously ill.
2. If you enter a race and come in last, you will have a long life.
3. An electoral candidate who dreams that he hears from elders far away will win the election.
6. If you have a date with a lady in your dream, this is the best time to go hunting; you will get everything you hunt.
7. In your dream, you enter a race. If you wave a big flag in it, good luck will always come to you.
8. If a lost buffalo comes back home again, a sick child in your family will get well soon.
9. If you walk in flat sand without any clothing, the weather will be fine.
The following dreams bring bad luck:
1.You dream that your house is on fire; someone sick in your family will die.
2.Dreaming of a typhoon, you find all the big trees uprooted. This means that the life of one of the leaders of the male work ranks will come to an end.
3. If you dream that there is a big rock blocking your way and you can't walk around it, this is a sign to abandon what you are doing, for you will certainly meet with failure.
5. Walking in the woods, you run across an animal which you can hunt, but you are scared. This means that you will be sick.
6. If you are in the water and catch a lot of fish, the weather will be bad soon or there will be hard rains.
7. If you see your field on fire, you will be poor this year because of crop failure.
8. If in your dream you are wrapped in a piece of cloth, you will be bitten by a snake or some other poisonous thing.
9. If you see many soldiers walking on a muddy road, they will lose their battle.
Now I tell you how to exorcise the bad luck of such dreams.
1.Get up as early as possible and scream into the woods or on a flat plain. You cry loudly, "What I have seen in my dream is not true." Then everything will be all right.
2. Ask the medium for help, telling him or her what you have seen in your dream.
AN ORNAMENT OF MEDIUM AND SORCERERESS
If [on a special day] you run across a medium who was once a widow or a sick person, something bad may happen to you that day. You must turn around if you see the medium in front of you; otherwise you need him or her to cure you. For this reason a medium should never visit a place where there is a happy event.
Blackbirds sitting in trees are also omens for the Amis. If you see a bird facing you, it is a good time to go hunting. If its back is turned to you, however, you must be careful in whatever you do on that day.
LUNCH CONTAINER AND GRAIN MEASURER
The Amis also make predictions based on crows. If a crow flies near the house, especially in front of the house, it means that something terrible will happen to the family. That is why the Amis people make noise or throw stones whenever they see a crow flying around the house.
Another sign I want to tell you about is the snake. If you see a snake sleeping when you are going hunting or going to work in the field, this is not a bad omen. If the snake crosses your path, however, this means your hunt will be fruitless, or that you must take great care, lest someone receive an injury.
Another omen I want to mention is the owl. An owl's cry at night signals the birth of a baby in the village. If we hear an owl cry "Gi! Gi!, the mother will have a girl; if it sings "Ko'! Ko', the elders say that we will soon have a new young gentleman among us. If the owls feel uneasy and fight with each other noisily, the couple nearby will quarrel very often and will never have a happy marriage.
Breaking wind in public is considered ill-mannered and is believed to bring bad luck. Breaking wind in the presence of elders will bring punishment upon the offender. There are several other situations in which one should not pass gas: 1. While drying the crops-it means that there will not be a good harvest next year or for a long time. 2. Before entering a barn to take out rice or pile up rice bags. The family will be poor forever. 3. When taking part in special events; this is rude. 4. Whenever an elder is giving a lesson to the younger generation. 5. Before going hunting or catching fish in the river. 6. While a magician practices his or her craft, or while all of the villagers are dancing in public.
If wild geese fly in an unusual formation or cry uncommonly, this a warning that there will be a battle between two tribes. It also means that burglars may do damage to the village. Should geese cry sadly while flying over the house at night, a sick person in the village will die soon.
Seeing a couple making love in the wild is also bad luck. If one happens to witness such an embarassing event, it is best to turn around and walk away quietly. Don't let them know you have seen them.
OFFERING
Sneezing is another action which brings bad luck. Whenever one gets up in the morning and someone is sneezing, one can expect that something bad will happen in the future. People are nervous all day long- who knows what may happen next? One must keep in mind the following prohibitions about sneezing: 1.While elders are making a speech. 2. While elders are praying or worshiping. 3. While a sorcereress is blessing or curing a patient. 4. When one is entering a barn to pile up or get some rice one's family may become poor for good. If you can't help sneezing, just walk away. Never let others know that you are sneezing.
LUNCH BASKET
Next I want to talk about the omens of the sun and the wind. If there is a blue cloud around the sun, someone in the village may die. If the cloud looks red, elders say that there might be a typhoon soon. If people hear a sound coming from deep in the ground, there might be an earthquake in the future. When we feel the wind blowing hot and then cold, this is an omen of a savage typhoon. If, while fishing in the river, we catch no fish, it means that there will be an earthquake. If we find the sea near the seashore foggy, this is also an omen of a typhoon. When the longan tree bears plentifully, there will be very strong typhoons that year. Where people eat a turtle and throw out its shell, that's where the eye of the typhoon will hit this year.
DURING THE HARVEST FESTIVAL, THERE ARE A LOT OF SUPERSTITIONS AND BELEIFS, LEARN THEM BEFORE TAKING PART.
"As the elders once have said, they had to built the watch house."
"The reason for the elders having built the watch house was that the watch house was the spot to watch or defend against an enemy. That's the way it was."
"The young men of the village gathered here in order to guard the village."
"If an enemy came, they couldn't enter and then not destroy their village."
"That was the reason why the youth of the village gathered in the watch house. It was the youth who were the defense in case the enemy came."
"The Amis and the Bunun were engaging in the state of mutual taking of heads."
"Being a chief of the village thought how they could make a reconnatissance and not let the Bunun come in. All that they could do was construct a watch house."
"Such custom of the Amis thus became a tradition up to today.
"Nowadays, there are no longer adawags because there are no enemies any longer. The government of the country is excellent, so the construction of adawags is no longer in need. So be it.
" There the story was."
"As for Idek, he really was a god, so he knew the proper time to plant."
"He carved the top like starfruit."
"If you carry the gourds, put them down with force in the reet matshere. If you carry pumpkins, put them down overhere! Do you all understand?"

This holiday, my sister and I went to Taitung to visit my uncle.
We took the train from Taipei to Taitung.
When we arrived in Taitung, my uncle drove to the station to pick us up.
The station is not far from my uncle's house, and it's just a short drive away.
There is a big ranch near my uncle's house, and we rode bicycles to the ranch together.
In the ranch, my uncle took us to feed the sheep and ride horses.
In the evening, we went to the city to have dinner together.
There are a lot of cars in the city, so we go there by motorcycle.
When we were about to leave, we found that the motorcycle had been stolen, so we had to leave by bus.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
When we were young, our family lived in Rinahem. After I started school, we moved to Taoyuan and have been living in the city ever since.
After I went to college, I took a course on aboriginal culture and learned that the aboriginal people in Taiwan have various and rich cultures.
So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
Although we could't fully understand it, we could record it on our cell phones and listen to it more.
When I was young, I didn't understand the culture of my ethnic group, and I was a little embarrassed that I was an aborigine.
The more I know, the more I feel that being a 'Amis is unique and something to be proud of.
My grandma and I went to the market to buy chickens and prepared a delicious dinner for my younger brother.

We bought pineapples and peaches.

Grandma thought it was too expensive and asked the boss if it could be cheaper.
The boss next door said, come and buy my fish, my fish is big and cheap.
In the end we bought chicken and fish, and went home to cook a table of food.
After waiting for a long time, it was already dark.
The younger brother called back and said that the army suddenly couldn't take a vacation and would not be back until the next Sunday.
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
We invited friends and family to have a great dinner together.
I have a classmate named Kacaw, he often forgets to bring things.
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
But he has a bad habit of often borrowing things but not returning them.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
One day, we all went on an outing together.
He borrowed toilet paper from his classmates, but everyone told him that I didn't bring them either.
Kacaw burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
The classmate told him, because you didn't bring it yourself, and you wouldn't return the things lent to you!
kacaw apologized to the students and said that he would definitely bring his own things in the future, and thanked the classmates for their willingness to lend him things before.
My dad is a hunter of the tribe.
When I was little, my dad and uncle would go out at night with hunting knives and guns.
They would divide the prey at the entrance of the village and share it with the tribe.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
Dad said that he would take me with me when I grew up.
The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
Dad saw it and told me that I will be a very good hunter in the future.
Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.
When returning to the village, share the hunted prey with the tribe.
Dad said, we want to thank the ancestors for their blessings, so that we have a lot of prey to harvest.

Kulas Vuting said, \The names written in indigenous languages are our true names. My name represents our ethnic group
Yesterday, I went to the market with my grandmother to set up a stall. My grandmother brought a lot of vegetables that she grew herself and also prepared indigenous cuisine for everyone.
Everyone loved my grandmother's stall. Many people bought the chilis and African eggplants, and many people came to taste the dishes she cooked.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
Our goods sold out quickly, and my grandmother said, \It's all thanks to your help.\""
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
Seeing my grandmother's passion for traditional food, I feel very proud and honored.

So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in Pangcah, as well as Bunun, Hakka and Japanese.
I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is a Bunun, and he knows many Hakkas at work, so he can speak so many languages.
During our interview, the old man talked about a lot of traditional knowledge about hunting.
When I was young, I didn't understand the culture of my ethnic group, and I was a little embarrassed that I was an aborigine.
