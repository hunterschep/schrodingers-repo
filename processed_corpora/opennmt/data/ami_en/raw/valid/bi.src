<2ami> On this day 22 years ago, the term "shanbao" (mountain people) in the Additional Articles of our Constitution was replaced with the proper name: "indigenous people." This correction not only did away with a discriminatory term, but also highlighted the status of indigenous peoples as Taiwan's "original owners." From this basis, today, we are taking another step forward. To all indigenous peoples of Taiwan: On behalf of the government, I express to you our deepest apology. For the four centuries of pain and mistreatment you have endured, I apologize to you on behalf of the government.
<2en> Paso'elin kako, tangasa anini i, taliyok no 'orip ako i, iray ho ko hamaan a ta'ongen sanay a tamdaw. Onini ko satadamaanay a demak no mako anini a komod to Cen- fo a mita'ong.

<2ami> I know that even now, there are some around us who see no need to apologize. But that is the most important reason why I am representing the government to issue this apology today. To see what was unfair in the past as a matter of course, or to treat the pain of other ethnic peoples as an unavoidable part of human development, this is the first mindset that we, standing here today, resolve to change and overturn.
<2en> Pakaynien ako i cecay a taneng no Yin- co-min-co, a pasowal to demak anini. I sowal no Tayal "so'linay a demak" sanay i, "Balay" han.

Ano pahci^ han ko sowal i, so'linay a kasasisolol i, deng so'linen ko faloco' a masaso'ayaw ta malahci ko demak.
<2ami> Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
<2en> Hinatala kako anini tona sa'opo^, o Cen- fo ato Yin-co-min-co i, masasi Sbalay. Oya moraraway ato so'linay a rayray no demak i 'ayaw i, hacecay a han no mako a patalahekal.

<2ami> I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.

<2ami> I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.
<2en> Wa ira ko pilongoc no mako to kaloyofayof a sa'opo^, misakalamkam a misalof to mapatalahoingay ciraraway na mi'adop i saliyoh, yo cilekakawa ko Yin-co-min-co, nawahani, citama' i caay ko sapili'acaaw. Orasaka, kilimen no mita ko saka nga'ay a makaykic nonini a demak.
<2ami> I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.
<2en> Anini a mihcaan 11 ko folad saka 1 a romi'ad, litapangto kami a nikenis pahapinang to saliyoh a sera no Yin-co- min-co.

Paroharohen no niyam a pasadak i Li-fa-Yin ko tadamaanay a demak no Yin-co-min-co to "rikec no pakoniyaniyah pikowan," "rikec no sera ato riyar," "rikec no saka comahad no sowal."
<2ami> On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.

<2ami> He put in the urn.

<2ami> He really came to the mountain to look for the frog, which he liked most.

<2ami> Under such circumstances, he went up and sat on the wood.

<2ami> Seeing those children, he believed that they were the thieves.

<2ami> 'Where is one of my baskets?'

<2ami> The rooster crowed. One day, there was a farmer who went to the farmland to work.
<2en> saka harateng sa cingra i kakoyhan ako ko ccay fakar latek ca'ay pakaaraw saka.
<2ami> So he thought, 'If I take one basket, maybe he won't see it.'
<2en> salihaday sa kiya falocoh niya wawa.
<2ami> The child (who stole the fruits) felt lighthearted.

<2ami> They saw many frogs in the river.

<2ami> left and went home with the dog.
<2en> e mik mikalang sa'an koya taywan toya sowal toya fawo.
<2ami> The Taiwanese said of the insect, " bites."
<2en> matengil niya mato'asay.
<2ami> It was heard by the old man.
<2en> nengnenghanen momokhan to noya waco ko koya patelian nira tiya takola' a talid.
<2ami> The dog got into the bottle where he put the frog.
<2en> ira ko ccay a 'pong itini i sota'.
<2ami> There was a hole here on the ground.

<2ami> 'Where is my frog?' he said so.
<2en> mikilim cingra.
<2ami> He searched.

<2ami> The tree was tall, and he climbed up.

<2ami> The young men selected from the various villages received secret training in the mountains. With the added encourage- ment of taking revenge on the Alikakay, they mastered all kinds of skills and techniques for defeating an enemy. They were divided into two groups. Those from the north villages was named Lalikid, which means that they would fight in unity; the others, from the south, chose the name Likoda, meaning that all members of the group were intelligent and brave. After much training in mock warfare they prepared to battle their real enemy. The first group assailed the village of the Alikakay with arrows tied with fireballs. The Alikakay thought nothing of this attack and said, "Come on! It is impossible for you to conquer us because we are so powerful." It was true. The other group, taking their place, expected to surmount all difficulties. They believed that they were the best sharpshooters with stones, and that the Alikakay would soon be conquered. However, even though they aimed at and hit the Alikakay, the enemies seemed impervious to the stones, and danced happily on the other side of the river. The Amis soldiers were frustrated because they were still unable to repel the Alikakay's advance. All of the clever old men and the chief-leaders of the villages held another conference to discuss their failure in battle. They decided that the Alikakay must be demons, and thus they turned to the sorcerers and sorceresses of the villages for help. They suggested that all spirits were afraid of monthly blood. So in their second attack, their arrows were all tied with pieces of soaked cloth. It worked; the Alikakay were revulsed and vomited. Still, nothing happened to them. The only way to finally defeat them was to cross the river and fight them hand-to-hand. This would be the third time for them to fight the Alikakay. It must be the last time for them in battle. On the night before the attack, none of the men were allowed to sleep with the women and none was allowed to eat vegetables - a practice called Manamet in Amis - in order that they might remain pure. The next day the terrible fight took place in the Alikakay's village. The Amis soldiers killed the Alikakay, but rapidly thereafter they came back to life. Beginning on the defensive, they eventually turned the tide, and the retreat of the Amis became a rout.

<2ami> Tonight I would like to talk about how the Amis name members of the younger generation. According to stories told by our ancestors, we were created by Doci. When we human beings appeared on this earth, Doci had already established everything: whether you would be a man or a woman, how long you will live on earth, who you will get married to, what you will be after growing up, etc. A newborn baby should be named three days after birth. In a poor family, people usually have a big dinner when christening the baby, in the hope of bringing good luck. During the dinner, the oldest members in the family will pick a name and ask everyone whether it is suitable for the newborn baby. In a rich family, the parents of the baby will invite the leader or the chief of village to come to their house. Sometimes they also call a magacian and hold a ceremony to choose a name. How does an elder choose a name for a baby?

<2ami> PROMOTING THE YOUNG MEN TO THE NEXT RANK The promotion of the ranks of Pakarongay and Latingwa is conducted by the leader of the village. He first introduces the young men who will rise to from the lowest rank, Pakarogay, to the rank of Latigwa. He tells them they are now men and may marry whoever they love. Then he introduces each of the new Pakarogay, welcoming these youngest members of the male work ranks on behalf of the all villagers. They will be trained to become men over the next few years. It is almost two o'clock when the ceremony ends. The dancing and the songs are all energetic and spirited.

<2ami> REWARDING GOOD DEEDS The third day, Sakatolo Pakomodan, is the day to praise good people and good deeds in our village. The activities are the same as the other days, beginning at two in the afternoon. The villagers honor people whose worthy deeds this year can be compared to those of our ancestors. These deeds bring harmony and prosperity to the village.
