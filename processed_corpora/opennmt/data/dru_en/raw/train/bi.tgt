President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
Cai Ying Weng Congtong patwakamani ki swa Siho kyaseasene ki kacalrisilrisiyane
I know that even now, there are some around us who see no need to apologize. But that is the most important reason why I am representing the government to issue this apology today. To see what was unfair in the past as a matter of course, or to treat the pain of other ethnic peoples as an unavoidable part of human development, this is the first mindset that we, standing here today, resolve to change and overturn.
wathingalako, pakelanga kai kameane, papiakikai ki tacekecekelaneta patolre, yakaiyana ko laomaomase ko kaipalraingi kiaseasene ko tapasalrivane lini. lakamani ko tokocingalreli naotara patokamani ki soa kongkoane kiaseasene sabao iya. nao tara topela pakabalrithi ko niposiranavane pakoalri pamatikoro, la kai kakathaane, amiyalringa kai, kikai amatikoroane akoalriane, taingeaane ka nibekacane kai ka nivothane, la kamani koini naotara sakai ko tacegeceganeli, si patopela tobavane ko takidremedremane iyako.
Let me put in simple terms why we are apologizing to the indigenous peoples. Four hundred years ago, there were already people living in Taiwan. These first inhabitants lived their lives and had their own languages, cultures, customs, and domains. But then, without their consent, another group of people arrived on these shores, and in the course of history, took everything from the first inhabitants who, on the land they have known most intimately, became displaced, foreign, non-mainstream, and marginalized.
nao arakai ko madoai ko vaga, pelaela ko palolodane ko akiaseasenaneli ki Yingcoming. kikai kadaengane kai Taiwang, sa kainakela ki tarasopate ka idai ka caili, sakoa ka cekelenga si ikainga ko iyakaikai, kikoini laomaomase la ngisasingikai ko takidremedremanelini cekecele, yakai ko kadaengane lini, yakai ko vagalini, yakai ko kopalelini, laikai ko nidarepane ko kakodhane
The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
kai Helange si Cengcengkong arakai ko tarvasane lini kai Taiwang la drepete si papacai ki Pingpozoko, la kabebetethe ko tacekecekelane, sa obalrithinga kai Laotia, la motalovaivainga ko makaroroboro ladrepete si tosinalreme, saka Dripongongo ko waerece magagemegeme sanakamanemane, la topela ko kakodhane toadripongane sanaka manamane, toalai ki tamakaroroborane pakela ki Laotia la pacongolo aroparamoro, moaalra ko kakodhaneta. kikai nitarasopatane ka idai ka caili, loka moabalrithi kela kai Taiwang, toabadha ki kacalrisiane si arakai ko makakaraboro la ngisasingkai malrakai kadaengane, tokadroanga ko lamanemame ki Kacalrisiane. ngoalai koini, ipatokamaniako ki soa kongkoane, papia ki Yingcoming sabao iya kiaseasene.
Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
kai Yingcomingco, arakai ko sidroadromane rathodo ki cekele, la arakai ko lrigilane ki sidroadromane kilibake ki kadaengane, lakai kabebebetethe capange ki lamanemane. ai, kikainga salri akabalrithingata ko kakodhane, kai Yinocomingco, kia pakaicilri sana ka manemane, kia drepete sikakodhane ko tangilralraingane lini, kadroanga ko kakodhanelini si kakodhane ki cekele, kaikiapatomanemanenga, ngoalai koini, ipatokamaniako ki soa kongkoane, papia ki Yinycoming sabao iya kiaseasene.
Indigenous peoples had their own languages. However, with Japanese rule aiming to assimilate and turn all into imperial subjects, and with the ROC government banning tribal languages after 1945, indigenous peoples' languages suffered great losses. Most Pingpu languages have disappeared. Successive governments have been negligent in the protection of indigenous cultures. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
kai Kacalrisilrisiane, toalai ko nadroma, yakainga ko vagalini, ai toalainga sakela ko Dripongo, la arakai ko kakodhane ki Dripongo, latocilri ko kinacalrisianane, lamialrisa ka 1945 ka caili toalainga koini, pakaicilri kai soa kongkoane parakai ko vagalini kaoriva, la toalai koini moalodro kaolrao ko vaga. inilringa kai Pingpozoko, kadroanga ko vagalini. ko tangilribalribatane ki soakongkoane, lakai tokocingalre kakalithi si kai pakaolrao kikai sidroadromane ka kakodhane. ngoalai koini, ipatokamaniako ki soa kongkoane papia ki Yingcoming sabao iya kiaseasene
Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.
kikai singi lalatadre lakela kai Taiwag si pakelanga kai, kai toacekele italitalriogane ka soa Pingpozoko asoalalanga kimocekele. sanaka wakela si ka singibadhane ko waerece ko kakodhane, tara moaalra ko tacekecekelane, twaolrao ko tasianeanane, ngoalai koini, ipatokama niako kisoa kongkoane papia ki swa Pingpozoko sabao iya kiaseasene.
Taiwan is known as a culturally diverse society. But even today, indicators on health, education, economic livelihood, political participation and more still show gaps between indigenous and non- indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, stereotypes and even discrimination against indigenous peoples have not gone away. The government has not done enough, so indigenous peoples have suffered pain and frustration unknown to other ethnic peoples. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
kai kadali kai takisamolanenai, ko tangilribatane maococongolo, kai sarawadrele ko kaika tapakelane kaongo, la kamaniko kipakoalrinomi, tengatengane ka sabao toramoro.
Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
la pacepaili, yarakaiyako ko lrigilanenomi ka Kacalrisiane, si pelaela kai raroboane kai kameane. iyakai ko vaga ki Taiyazoko, tangimiamiane loiyakovagalini amiya, la ko sakidalroane sbalay laiya. lo picocobongane ki balay si padrima ko s ka lingao. tangimiamiane si sakidalroane, yakai ko patharevane ko kakodhane. lo carongocongane pelaela. ko patengatengane si makisodalrodalromado, pasingia kidremedrememado matatoalrevegemodo. la mathingathingnle ko tangimiamiane, lrimadawdaroromado si ngimiya.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
ikai ki kakodhane ki Kacalrisiane, alaiyasi ikai ko pasalrio ki badhabadha, ta ngosamadrane si maki dalrodalro loiya, ko marodrange ki cekele wadawlo ki pasalrio si kiapasalrio la taelre irobo, lo irobo kaimakakai makiaseasene, mapelaela podriadringai mapobelebelenge ko kidremedremelini, lo tolrepengenga lapolebe ko bava ko marodrange la kalringolo matakitakili, tako mapalribalribate tokakadroa ko pasalrivane si samadrane. lakoini kakodhane toa sabalay laiya.
I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.
siadramako kai tairoboaneta kai kameane, anatomane la arakaita ko kakodhane ki sabalay lamakitobitobi mapalribalribate lamaicobongo ka soa kongkoane si Kacalrisiane, la iraroboaneta mapelaela mapobelebelenge ko pasalrivaneta. kai kameane kainako oathoro naokiaseaseneiya, ai lako asidramanenomi tapikidremedreme makanaelre, tamabalibali mapasapokopokoane, lani kaingipelanenga ko matikoroane ko takoalriane, tamakitobitobi ko angidarepane ko amakakidalroane.
Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
toapathagilita si tokaroalai kai kameane lakathane, ko lringimia si kailringimia kaika yakai nomiane ka Kacalrisiane si Pingpozoko, ko tangatenganelringa lrika soa kongkoane ko magagemegeme. wathingalako kaikadali kalekete loarakaiyane ko ngodoi karaleale lakathane, ko apasikaiyane ki Kacalrisiane pia sanakamanemane amanilringa ko apatoaladhane, alacegecege ko tengatengane ko samakakidalroane.
Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
lakai lrisakaiyakokai pelaela nomiane, lri pikaiyako kai Congtongho cegecege ko tamapelaelane ko atopacengecengane ko tapasalrivane. koako lalri sakaiyako ko takatalialaaladhaneli ki Ciokoko kai kameane, si kamani ka magagemegeme ko aongane, lalri taelrenai ki wadaiho ki Kacalrisilrisiane si darepe cegecege ko morikaita, ko taetaleta ka Kacalrisilrisiane si swa kongkoane yarakaita ko mababalrealreanane malalekete, alamapelaela ko apapiane asilolodane ki cekele.
I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.
lai pelaelako podriadrangai, koini tara mapelaelaela ikai Congtongho, ko makociacingalrenga, amani kai cekeleta si Yingcoming ko amalaleketane amababalrealreanane. ko patoakamani, amani kai Pingpo zoko, swadratane, Kacalrisilrisiyane, itaraka nimapalrailraingane ka kidremedreme ki mapapangale. kikai raroboane, ikamani ko mapelaela torathodane ko morikaikaita akolikolita ka kinaocekelane ka Yingcoming makanaelre.
I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.
itarapasoalako tokocingalre kitobi ko kiaparaisi ko aongane, tara pasoala demele ko ngwakai ki Kacalrisiane ko aongane, kai Kacalrisiane lo ngoalai ki kakodhane, la kai ki dremedreme ko atoracevane malalangadhane, lamoa ki sakoakadaenganelini toalai ko nadroma, lo alopo si kipoalra la kitopasalrivane si kisaibange. lakamani lokabibilrili kikai ngoalai ki nitopasalrivane ko kakodhane singi kadroma, ta irobo makanaelre lamapelaela si tobavane ko kakodhane.
I will also direct relevant agencies to present an investigative report on the decision-making process of nuclear waste storage on Orchid Island. Before finding a permanent solution for the nuclear waste, we will provide the Yami tribe appropriate compensation.
lai kitobiako ko amani ko piaonganane, ngwalai kai ki obolo ki dingki, ko totacilricilriane pikai Langi toalai sa lripathagili pakelanga kai, lri pelaela ko tangilribatane kotangimiamiane. sakai tolrepengeana demele ko apangimiane kai ki obolo ki dingki, lai tara pasoalanata osakene ki Yamizoko, labai ko sapangibilriane ko takoalrianelini.
At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.
kai asasane, ngwalai ko taosakenaneta ki Pingpozoko, ko tangipapalrainganelini, tangithathingalanelini, ko tangipapolringavanelini, amaniako ko tengatenganeiya, loka bangate ka dramare si matolrolo ka vai, kaika apalribatane koini, lai mapelaela ko amamamoane ko kakodhane, lani sara arakai ko tacekecekelane, takaomaomasanelini.
On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.
kai caili kai asaane, loka mangeale si vaeva ka dramare si vaeva ko vai, ipathagilinganai agisi kai kadaengane, lalri pelaelanai ko kadaengane ki Yingcoming, ko tangimiamiane, ko sarakaiyane mapelaela ki cekele, la arakaikainganai ko kakodhane. lo kabibilrili, ko morikaikaita, ko aingikakadrengane ki Yingcoming iyasidramadrama itarangimiya. koini makociacingalrenga ka morikaikaingata. ka sarakaiyane ki Yingcoming tokakodhane, sarakaiyane ki Yingcoming tokakodhane ki kadaengane si laveke, sarakaiyane ki Yingcoming tokakodhane ki vagalini, patoelre koini, lai satedrenai poa kavai Lripoing, lai drele si mapelaela pangilribate si pangimiya.
Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.

To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.

I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.

In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.
loka bibilrili, lripatoalainai ko nitatokakodhane lakisamola padromolro ko aongane, lata bai ki laganeta, lata pataromara ki lagaganeta, patoelre sanaka yakai kikai kadaenganeta ka swa Taiwang ka laomaomae, lanikai sakacilringa ko vaga, anikai sakaolraonga ko nibekacane ka tacekecekelane. anikai ngolalalatadrenga kipapapalai, kaithingalenga mobalrio motavanane.
I call upon our entire society to come together and get to know our history, get to know our land, and get to know the cultures of our many ethnic peoples. Let us work towards reconciliation, a shared existence and shared prosperity, and a new future for Taiwan.

This swing can be lifted and carried.

What I'm saying is about our names in Rukai.
kay apelaelaane li amani kikay nagana ta ka Ngodradrekay.
The names we create include the name of humans, the name of home, and the name of any living things. Even grass has its name.
eh tasonaganagane ta kikay lanagane ta kay nagane yaie kay omaomase yakay ko nagane ini kay daane yaie la ikay ko nagane ini sanaka manemane ka waodriodripi kay obolo la ikay ko nagane ini.
What I'm going to say is about the name of humans.
kay apelaelaane li yaie ipelaela ako kay nagane ki omaomase.
One day, when the enemy attacked the tribe, there is no people strong enough to fight and help the tribe in defense.
kikay nagane ko makociacingalre nga yaie kikay nagane yiae taingeaane ka sangolrialringawane koini tangilribateane koini ki omaomase kodra takasaniangeane ini tapiaane ini yaie soa nagane mado maroamani nga kikay aloiyaane yakay kodra la sa ka vaivai si la ikay kodra badha kodra waorikai ki cekele kitonolo koini eh tinoacekeleane yaie la kakadroa kodra marakace kodra eh wadolro si eh kikaroboroboro ki badha.
The tribe was waiting for the man to come, but he didn't show up.
ai la ikay kodra laso kodra taingeaane la kakadroa koini ki cekele koini sa ka vaivai koini kinaocekeleane law kilavalava si okalavalava ikela loigane ikela loigane.
IRR this man comes, he might save the tribe.
ala lripaodripi mitaane la iya kodra kinaocekeleane ala kela koini laso.
When the tribe was waiting, he came and killed the enemy, forcing them to wade and escape.
sakilavalavaane koini kinaocekeleane sa kela koini laso lalra pakatoase koini ki badha si ala kirimo talobalre ki eh.
When he killed the enemy for the tribe, the people praised and thanked him.
sa papacay koini ki tanicekeleane koini cekeleane la drengedrengere si kiaseasene.
We wait for him to come help us at tribe. Oh! he come!
la iya koini moakalava koini kinaocekeleane koini laso koini ikela koini lripalribolo mitaane ala kela koini laso.
To help them.
la palribolo liniane.
They survived the death.
la ngilribate ki sapapacay.
These names are created OBLording to the wisdom, capabilitity and perfectness.
la si pato la si koini laso koini kalava la ka taingeaane koini kodra rakacaane koini ki laso eh kikay nagane ta la ka miyaiya koini yakay kodra pathoarakai ki rakacaane koini miyaiya koini la kikay yaie.
There are many male names like Drangalru, Laucu, Lavurase, Kui, Mulaucu, Vulruku, Takanau, and Rumalidi.
eh la kikay saovalay ko sia Drangalro sia Laoco sia Lavorase sia Koi sia Molaoco sia Volroko sia Takanaw sia Romalidi.
Thus if one is called one of these names, he is a leader.
la laisi sonagane koini la miyaiya koini soa tavanane amiya ki koini.
If one is called Culuculu, Muni, Elrenge, Cemedase, Dresedrese and Alayumu, or other names like these, she is a leader.
la kikay yaie lo si Colocolo lo si Moni lo si Elrenge eh kila ki koini nala yaie ai kai ka thathaane koini maiya makalrana yaie amani koini kodra nagane kay ki eh soa tavanane.
But these men are called Palange, Cibuku, Valrialane and Paerece for their power, wisdom, and hunting skills.
ka kay lasaovalay la ikay kodra sia marakace kodra sapokoane la kikay sia sia Ciboko sia Valrialane sia Paerece.
It's like this.
eh koini la miyaiya yaie.
We don't have names that sound weak or bad.
kay nagane ki saovalay yaie kai soanaganagane ko tatoramoroane ko tangilisiane.
These are all male names.
kikay nagane ki saovalay.
For female names, there are Deresai, Lebetai,Kaniyu, and Sulriape.
la kikay la kay sia Lrailrai sia Deresai sia Lebetai sia Kaniyo sia Solriape maela kikay koini nala yaie eh lakawkawlo.
Besides, for chieftains and commoners there are names for brothers and sisters.
ai la ikay ko taingeaane nga kikay kabecelrekane ki soa tavanane si lakawkawlo yakay kodra si nagane ki tagiagi amiya.
Names like Ngedrelre and Repunu are for siblings also.
ala kikay lanagane ki tagiagi la kodra sia Legeane sia Venenge kodra la miyaiya koini yaie eh kikay sia Ngedrelre sia Repono kodra la miyaiya koini yaie tagiagi ka saovalay.
Men are named sugar cane, rattan or grass.
kay saovalay la sonagane ko sia sia rogoso sia obolo.
This is the advantages of having these names.
amani kodra mathariri toramoro kikay lo e sonaganeane.
We have these names because of superstition.
kikay nagane ta ka omaomase yakay ko satolrisilrisiane.
Having these names can prevent disasters.
lo sonaganeane la mado si karetege koini molisi mado.
We Rakui people have names for each family.
kay daane ta ka Ngodradrekay ko vaeva ko daane la ikay sanaka daane yakay koini nagane ini koini daane.
These names are Dumalralrase, Dalapaiane Avalrengane, Taitaukadu, Tavelengane, and Taiaruladenge, all for families.
la ka yakay koini sia e dalapaiane avalrengane la ngimiyaiya koini e daane kayki nagane.
For the Hans, the relatives to the Chens are all named Chen, like Mr. Chen and Ms. Chen.
maroamani nga kodra sing chen lo iyaane kodra maredredrese kay payrange dooshi chen chen xiansheng chen noshi amiya.
But we Rukai people do not have surnames, only names.
ai kay Ngodradrekay yaie koini la mata kikay nagane ta ka omaomase yaie kadroa kodra xing kadroa kodra sapathagili nagane la kasane la kaamani kodra nagane ta ka omaomase si nagane kay ki daane nagane kay ki laobo laobobolo yaie.
The Hans do not create names this way.
la kadroa ko e tamamoamoaane miya kay ki mosonagane kay eh payrange.
This is the origin of our names.
la ngimiyaiya kikay nagane ta eh nagane ta.
We cannot have names in haste.
kikay nagane mado la kaido sonaganagane cacapange.
There is a name for family, just like the Taugatuane family has its own name.
yakay ko nagane mado ka taianeane kikay nagane ki wataogatoane yakay ko wataogatoaneane ko nagane.
The name Urareteng belongs to the Urareteng family, one can has it only when he is a member of the family.
kikay taiorareteng yakay kodra koini nagane koini ki taiorareteng lo ka cocongoloane mado soa nagane mado.
If you take others' name you will lose your relatives and have no children, so (the tradition) is very good.
kaido wamalramalra ko palrapalraane laikay so moretesane laisokai laikai kamodo ko erai nomi amiya si la kathariri toramoro.
Regarding the people's names, they are related to taboos.
e la kikay nagane ta ka yakay kodra mamamoa ki taolisisiane.
If we are in the hell and our names interest the ghosts, they will take away our souls.
kikay nagane ta ka omaomase yaie alayasi ikay ta taidridringiane lo arakay ta kay nagane ta ka omaomase yaie alayasi kadalame kodra ai dridringiane wamalra kikay abake ta ka omaomase.
If we are in the hell, we cannot use good names, but bad names, like Apilici, and hope the ghosts will not take the souls away.
lo ikay ta koini ki taidridringiane yinjian de difang kaido arakay kay kodra mathariri kodra nagane arakay mado kodra ngialisiane yakay koini sia kodra la ngimia koini ngialisiane ani kalrase kay ai dridringiane la kai malra kay abake ini si.
Thus, when people meet each other, especially when a man courts a woman, her mother will definitely ask what the man's name is.
la kaamani ko naidroadroma lo lrimoaane kodra ki taidridringiane la pealaela nga kay la tina mado la tama mado lo ikay mado kavay yaie kai so lrimakaiya kay nagane so lo ikay so kayki cakeakena amia si la ka miyaiya koini si nagane ta ka soaVedai yaie makocingalre toramoro lo kai e lo kaido thingale lo toalayane kayki nagane ta wathingale mado ko taianeane mado ko takane takamanemaneane mado ka la kaamani lo taomadredreeleane kayki palrapalra e inilringa lo papalangeane ka saovalay tarakiavaga kodra tiatina kodra ki aliso amia sia aneaneso.
If the man's name is for chieftains, then wow! Your boyfriend is an aristocrate! Then the man will be well treated.
amia si alayasi naganeane ko sia Lavorase wa talialalay kay laso la iya la pasodaolro mosoane kodra wakela kay abelenge kay talialalay amia si.
What are you coming for?
manemane kay kelakela nomi?.
We are aristocrats!
talialalay nay.
You are scorning us?
toasinalremene nomi nayane amia si.
So ask (our parents) in advance who we are courting.
la kivagaana mado pasoala sia aneane ko aopapalangeane nay.
I finished the story about names.

Another is pulling the goat:Another one is sheepping the goat.

And he walked by the three children.

And then his dog liked that.
la kodra taopongo ini madalame.
He shook and watched.
papangoa dingidingi si siavavava taiya.
When the child was sleeping, the frog jumped out.
saapece koini vavalake kodra yaie koini iyaw kodra yaie alaka waitoko.
That frog is very good (at something).
kay marakace kay iyaw yaie.
No matter how small the bottle is, the frog jumped up and down, and finally ran away from the uncovered bottle mouth.
kodra si adravane kodra mia koini ka didilrongo taiya kodra marakace itoko la itoko koini iyaw si katoase obere taiya la ngokay koini ginganga kai kanicaebaane.
The child got up.

And was surprised and said, "Why was there no frog?"

And then kept looking at the bottle from his bed in this way.

That girl asked where the frog has gone.
si la moaino a ini laiya kodra taiya ali so kodra.
I don't know whether is male or female
kay vavalake taiya kodra naw kai thingale loka ababay loka saovalay.
When he came down from the bed, he thought that might be inside the shoes.
ai sae la molebe koini ki tapeapecane si imoadringi nga kay ki kece li laiya kodra ko kece ini kodra.
And he held the long, thick rubbers and looked down into them. And then he went inside the hole.
maelrenge kodra marorodromo kodra si la alra kodra amigece ini si papolelelebe ko ko velevelevele ala si moadringi kay ki barongolo.

The bottle's shape was like the glass.

How about the dog?

When did this, how could it be the dog?

said this surprisingly and then held the dog angrily.

"Is it you that take it?" And then said.

"Is it you that eat?" He scolded and asked.
amani so ko wakane laiya kaelaelaela koini.
Is it that dog, or the child?
ki kay taopongo ini ki kay eh vavalake taiya.
The dog kept barking, "Where did he go?"
la ese thatVISPROX yaie la taotaotao koini moainoa ini koini yaie.
When he said so, then the dog followed and barked.
saiya kodra yaie la topapapalra kay taopongo ini alealeale taiya.
When was barking in this way, indicating that there was one hornet in a tree.
saalealeale kodra yaie la ikay kodra iya belenge ki angato ko sigo taiya.
From his voice, two kinds of voice, the hornet came out and flied.
la kay singkai kodra ki lingao ini si lingao kay ki tadrosa kodra si kainganay ngipalapalay kikay yaie lasigo.
That child looked at the hornets along the hole.
kay vavalake la papia koini barorongolo tailebe koini taikayane ki sigo si oh la papia kay vavalake dredrele la ikay kodra kolrabao toalay koini ki oh loloto taiya.
The child was surprised.
kasamalimali kay vavalake kasamalimali kay yo.
What's hanged in the tree?

The dog went to the trunk where the hornets live and scratched the trunk.
la moa koini ta ngatoane koini ki sigo si ta ngatoane ki angato si garaoraoco ki taopongo taiya.
Then these hornets kept humming; the voles were surprised and frightened. That's how it is.
