President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
I know that even now, there are some around us who see no need to apologize. But that is the most important reason why I am representing the government to issue this apology today. To see what was unfair in the past as a matter of course, or to treat the pain of other ethnic peoples as an unavoidable part of human development, this is the first mindset that we, standing here today, resolve to change and overturn.
Let me put in simple terms why we are apologizing to the indigenous peoples. Four hundred years ago, there were already people living in Taiwan. These first inhabitants lived their lives and had their own languages, cultures, customs, and domains. But then, without their consent, another group of people arrived on these shores, and in the course of history, took everything from the first inhabitants who, on the land they have known most intimately, became displaced, foreign, non-mainstream, and marginalized.
The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Indigenous peoples had their own languages. However, with Japanese rule aiming to assimilate and turn all into imperial subjects, and with the ROC government banning tribal languages after 1945, indigenous peoples' languages suffered great losses. Most Pingpu languages have disappeared. Successive governments have been negligent in the protection of indigenous cultures. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.
Taiwan is known as a culturally diverse society. But even today, indicators on health, education, economic livelihood, political participation and more still show gaps between indigenous and non- indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, stereotypes and even discrimination against indigenous peoples have not gone away. The government has not done enough, so indigenous peoples have suffered pain and frustration unknown to other ethnic peoples. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.
Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.
I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.
I will also direct relevant agencies to present an investigative report on the decision-making process of nuclear waste storage on Orchid Island. Before finding a permanent solution for the nuclear waste, we will provide the Yami tribe appropriate compensation.
At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.
On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.
Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.
To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.
I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.
In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.
I call upon our entire society to come together and get to know our history, get to know our land, and get to know the cultures of our many ethnic peoples. Let us work towards reconciliation, a shared existence and shared prosperity, and a new future for Taiwan.
I call upon all citizens to seize the opportunities offered by this day - to join together, work hard, and build a country of justice, a country of true diversity and equality.
Thank you all

When he gives, this boy is thanked and this boy is given two.
These mangos then are distributed to these friends
Then the three walks away.
He is haunted (by the question) is it my other one of mango?
There is a story which is told like this
It is the story of balenge
There was the one called Balenge in the old times.
Balenge was from Lapu.
One day, Balenge walk away and went to that mountain.
When went and walk to the mountain, picked herbs and flowers.
went to that mountain.
Then went to Talubalringi.
There is that snake, that hundred pacer.
What should I do and I could talk to her.
This hundred pacer said, "I (am going to) become a human."
"Then maybe that Balenge will like me."
(The hundred pacer) quickly turned into a human.
When became a human, was a handsome young man.
When Balenge saw him, then said "Wow! Who is this handsome young man and why is he here?"

Balenge said sure.
Every day came to help Balenge to work.
The hundred pacer then liked Balenge.
Then Balenge said fast.
If Balenge looked at Adralriu, is like a human.

One day Adralriu said.
Two left and went to the tribe, Lapu.
When arrived at Lapu and the elders saw them and said: "Why looks like a hundred pacer, a snake?"
said to Balenge: "Why are you like the hundred pacer, the snake?"
"No, Father Mother. is not a snake. is a human."
"No, is a snake."

Then is surprised that Balenge does not agree with them.

"What should we do? I must marry the snake."
"What should we do?"
" notify nobles of the tribe and discuss."
The elders then said.
"We talk to the hundred pacer."
If you say "I must go Balenge."
"The most important thing."
"You must bring the lazurite bead, the real lazurite bead."
"Secondly, you must bring the steel pot, the real steel pot."

Look, if there is anything I do not carry, tell.
Then, the noble look at that and say: "Be! Why is there everything?"
Then promised their wedding.
Then made Balenge and Adralriyu get married.
Then get married, and have a ceremony, and then leave.
Say, if I have left; enter the sea, and have a family with the snake, cottonmouth. It's a farewell.
Someday, if you came here you see the young cottonmouth, my children should be protected.
In addition, when you come to Dalupalringi you see the cold water, don't touch it.

Then say "take care" to them.
All the elders are crying and walking away; walk to the tribe and are with care.

This story...

The frog came from the bottle stealthily, and slowly ran away.
When the boy and his dog woke up, saw the frog is not inside the bottle.

The two, that kid and that dog, were very happy.
At the end, took one of the frog's companion and bring it home.
Then the frogs parted with reluctance when those three left.
Why do say that?
When are plowing, we divide the work to others or seek for others' helps.
very interesting
After plowing, wait for planting seeds.
If the seeds are planted, should wait and watch for birds in order not to eat their crops.
When it reaches six months, it is the millet season
should reap the millet and put it under the sun.
If take much millet, they do the pakubalriyu
Finishing this, would save the millet and wait for the festival.
The leader will lead the seniors, and then start to do the millet-baking ceremony.

The opening-jar in Rukai is that opening the liquor, and knowing whether the liquor is sour or sweet.
Let the leader drink first.
After leader finished the drinking, let presbyter drink.
Then the leader switch position select the best liquor and use it in the ceremony next year.

takes one and leave the others on the trunk.
Then is happ and brings one frog with him and go back home.
What I'm saying is about our names in Rukai.
The names we create include the name of humans, the name of home, and the name of any living things. Even grass has its name.
What I'm going to say is about the name of humans.
One day, when the enemy attacked the tribe, there is no people strong enough to fight and help the tribe in defense.
The tribe was waiting for the man to come, but he didn't show up.
IRR this man comes, he might save the tribe.
When the tribe was waiting, he came and killed the enemy, forcing them to wade and escape.
When he killed the enemy for the tribe, the people praised and thanked him.
We wait for him to come help us at tribe. Oh! he come!
To help them.
They survived the death.
These names are created OBLording to the wisdom, capabilitity and perfectness.
There are many male names like Drangalru, Laucu, Lavurase, Kui, Mulaucu, Vulruku, Takanau, and Rumalidi.
Thus if one is called one of these names, he is a leader.
If one is called Culuculu, Muni, Elrenge, Cemedase, Dresedrese and Alayumu, or other names like these, she is a leader.
But these men are called Palange, Cibuku, Valrialane and Paerece for their power, wisdom, and hunting skills.
It's like this.
We don't have names that sound weak or bad.
These are all male names.
For female names, there are Deresai, Lebetai,Kaniyu, and Sulriape.
Besides, for chieftains and commoners there are names for brothers and sisters.
Names like Ngedrelre and Repunu are for siblings also.
Men are named sugar cane, rattan or grass.
This is the advantages of having these names.
We have these names because of superstition.
Having these names can prevent disasters.
We Rakui people have names for each family.
These names are Dumalralrase, Dalapaiane Avalrengane, Taitaukadu, Tavelengane, and Taiaruladenge, all for families.
For the Hans, the relatives to the Chens are all named Chen, like Mr. Chen and Ms. Chen.
But we Rukai people do not have surnames, only names.
The Hans do not create names this way.
This is the origin of our names.
We cannot have names in haste.
There is a name for family, just like the Taugatuane family has its own name.
The name Urareteng belongs to the Urareteng family, one can has it only when he is a member of the family.
If you take others' name you will lose your relatives and have no children, so (the tradition) is very good.
Regarding the people's names, they are related to taboos.
If we are in the hell and our names interest the ghosts, they will take away our souls.
If we are in the hell, we cannot use good names, but bad names, like Apilici, and hope the ghosts will not take the souls away.
Thus, when people meet each other, especially when a man courts a woman, her mother will definitely ask what the man's name is.
If the man's name is for chieftains, then wow! Your boyfriend is an aristocrate! Then the man will be well treated.
What are you coming for?
We are aristocrats!
You are scorning us?
So ask (our parents) in advance who we are courting.
I finished the story about names.
There is an old man who leaves for mountain and will take guavas.
Then left to the top to take guavas.
brings three baskets.
is passing his guava-taking place and walk away.
After passing, there is a child riding his bike passing by his guava-picking place just in time.
This child, when passes the guava-taking place of the old man; stopped; takes a look, and takes the guavas.
put into his bike, and then left with basket that is full of guavas.
He left two baskets of guava.
When was leaving, wanted to see the girl and his hat dropped.
Then leaves to fell.
When fell,all the guava has been thrown out,and his leg hurts.
However, when he fells, those three pals come and these kids are like him.
When are walking and see him, then help him taking the guavas and put all the guavas into the basket.
When have picked up all the guavas; then put into the bike, and then these three pals left.
When the three male pals was leaving, then see and "why is this hat here"; and say "hey! your hat!"
then walk to give that...
The three male friends is leaving and eating this guavas which is given to them by their friend"
says "why is my guava not there, the one basket of guava?"
Then saw the three passing, as long as eating.
walked away and didn't know that these guavas being eaten by them were stolen.
was staring and saying:"how strange! Where did my guavas go?"
There is a story which I would say.
One is pomelo.
Another is pulling the goat:Another one is sheepping the goat.
When the old man was harvesting the pomelo, a young man rode a bike passing by.
He put this in the bicycle and leave.
Then, there are three people coming.
One child is mixed,and then there are two young mans.
Then, this girl wants to leave.
Then these men are leaving and separating, they see that hat of this girl.
This, for the sake of this story.
If human do this, they would encounter hardship;say, see the woman and man.
When fall like this, the three young man say "why this hat of the girl drops" and leave.
gives a lesson to this girl and that boy, the old man did not think that it would be like this.
Then, like the story I say.
These three men is telling this girl another to be a human.
This is exactly the story I want to say.
The one who makes a crime will not have good luck
His hat which dropped is return firstly.
(Another thing) should be put in mind is exactly that his personality will make crimes.
My saying is enough.
OK, finished.
There was an old man.
Then he went to their mango farmland.
They brought that basket in order to fill it.
With their goats, the children walked by the old man.
Here came a child who rode a bicycle.
That child raised his head and looked at that old man.
After the child left and then?
He looked at that girl, hit a big stone and fell down.
The three friends looked at him.
And they helped him replace the scattered mango.
What could we do after filling it?
That child left.
The three children saw his hat on the floor.
He used his hand to whistle
The person who stole mango looked back.
He stood up and said, "What are they taking about?"
There came another friend.
gave him his hat.
Then they parted.
He descended, counted the number of his basket, and wondered why one disappeared.
And he walked by the three children.
He stood quietly, and said with surprise, "Where are the mangoes?"
There was a child.
And then he liked to play that.
There was a transparent bottle.
And then his dog liked that.
He shook and watched.
When the child was sleeping, the frog jumped out.
That frog is very good (at something).
No matter how small the bottle is, the frog jumped up and down, and finally ran away from the uncovered bottle mouth.
The child got up.
And was surprised and said, "Why was there no frog?"
And then kept looking at the bottle from his bed in this way.
That girl asked where the frog has gone.
I don't know whether is male or female
When he came down from the bed, he thought that might be inside the shoes.
And he held the long, thick rubbers and looked down into them. And then he went inside the hole.
But there was nothing.
And then his dog went into that bottle immoderately.
entered the bottle, smelled it and went into the big bottle.
The bottle's shape was like the glass.
How about the dog?
When did this, how could it be the dog?
said this surprisingly and then held the dog angrily.
"Is it you that take it?" And then said.
"Is it you that eat?" He scolded and asked.
Is it that dog, or the child?
The dog kept barking, "Where did he go?"
When he said so, then the dog followed and barked.
When was barking in this way, indicating that there was one hornet in a tree.
From his voice, two kinds of voice, the hornet came out and flied.
That child looked at the hornets along the hole.
The child was surprised.
What's hanged in the tree?
The dog went to the trunk where the hornets live and scratched the trunk.
Then these hornets kept humming; the voles were surprised and frightened. That's how it is.
The child went up the tree. There was a hole on the tree.
And then the child peeped at the hole: "What is inside the hole?"
Why is this a hole?
The child was surprised at those holes.
The owl came out from it.
The owl slept in the holes of trees.
The dog was chasing the bees. And the child was so frightened that he fell down from the tree.
The child fell down because he was afraid of this.
Bees were chasing dogs.
What about the child then?
He was afraid of the owl.
The hornet wanted to sting us. We left and walked above the big rock.
The child on the rock thought of the horn of the goat as the tree and touched it.
Their dog kept barking.
When the child touched it, he didn't know it was the goat's horn.
The goat was jumping and running and then left. It also took away the child.
The dog asked the goat: "He is my master. Why do you take it away?"
Then the goat came to the cliff; it was so frightened that it stopped. Then the child was sprung from the goat.
Why say water is below while the goat is above?
It stopped and the dog fell down. The child fell down as well.
The goat looked below and said sorry to them.
The child jumped into the water and carried the dog on his shoulder.
The child left for the riverside. There was a hole. So they went up the tree.
Keep quiet.
Why did say so?
The child saw the frog in the back.
When the dog was quiet, there were two frogs in the back of the hole of the tree.
The child picked up the frog immediately.
When there were two frogs, the child took away the only one.
The frog was taken away and its companions were surprised.
And then said goodbye and left.
The dog and the child took the frog away.
So the story is like this.
He walks to the mountain happily to pick jelly.
When he is taking the jelly, he is happy.
Then say this is here...and this is here.
His child then counts the jelly.
When leaving, bumped into my bike.
All the jelly they carry fall to the ground.
Then everyone is happy and leaving.
Then the owner of the jelly sells the jelly happily.
Then finish their thinking.
It is important to obey the elders for having a family.
Rukai people would like to get married.
If (two families need a ceremony, should give gifts and dine together; heart will be close
discussed this.
Then, if is in a hurry, then the spirit of (the two families) will have no connection.
The dowry is different for nobles, civilians, and non-eldest sons.
So for necessity, the dowry, there are nobles', non-eldest sons', and civilians'.
The dowry will be used for the wedding.
The recent dowry is wood.
The male must at first lumber the wood.
There must be food.
The food contains pork.
The pork must be rump and sirloin.
There must be rice cake.
These are very important.
These are called dowry.
The dowry must be put down first.
Dowry must be new if is put down.
The dowry, there will must be wood.
There is also pork; they are exactly rump, sirloin, neck.
Then there are rice cake; then there are millet; then there are liquor; then there are betel nut; there are lime.
You will be capable of all the treatment; then put down this...put down these necessities.
This is the "dowry" in Taiwanese.
First, if want to put down the necessity, and (there must be) machete and iron pot.
If you are a civilian, this in the upper part.
This is noble's clay pot; this is civilian clay pot.
There must be this; there must be a necklace.
Civilians need to give one of this.
The civilians, this...There are shoulder belts for the civilians.
use this shoulder belt.
This wedding dress is not to give you; I put it off and give to you.
Then put off this wedding dress.
There is also land (in the dowry), if you were rich; you land together.
The nobles, their spirit and their power are different.
There are giving this rivers and hunting fields.
There are this kind of nobles.
it must be that the highest head band of the bribe, not the groom in that day.
The female need to put the fur in the head bend.
Traditionally, the woman must give and put the fur in the head bend.
She is a virgin, a pure woman.
The symbol of a virgin must be made by lily.
Then a grasp of male eagle fur is for the noble or elders.
(Then a grasp of male eagle fur) is for the noble or elders.
If the Rukai person is pure, will do this.
Only virgin and those engaged in public can have holy wedding ceremony.
who commit suicide for frustrated love or elope will have no such a wedding ceremony.
When mutually accept this, should dance.
It is that when the ceremony takes place, everyone in the tribe should wear traditional costume; join the wedding and dance.
dance, they to escort the female and return.
To Rukai people, the escorting is very important.
There is an old Rukai custom called "grab marriage."
Rukai people stress on the chastity of woman.
When we leave, should carry the female.
Wrap cloth is used when the female is sent to the male's house; it is worn to protect the private part of body.
This is cloth-wrapping.
If come to the male's place
The grab marriage is not what people are talking about now: man and woman mutually accept, and enter the house to get laid.
Because the woman is wearing the wrap cloth for private-part protection, when the coupe is sent into the room, the man must unwrap those things with bare hands.
Because the wrapping is too solid, sometimes it takes three to four days for the couple to get laid.
The couples sleep.
This is the wedding ceremony of Rukai; I stopped saying here.
Hello! Every one!
Now am going to tell a story about the importance of women and men in Rukai nowadays.
Rukai people is often being asked by us: Whether we emphasize the man or woman?
to Rukai.
From eating, clothing and doing things
Still, the way of eating is different.
When eating, men and women in Rukai must respect men.
The Man must know he takes care of women.
We need to see the spoon; like this, the handle of the spoon of women is thin and long.
You women will eat slowly with the mouth narrowly open.
Do not open the mouth widely.
You need to be slow, and then the deportment is good.
That is not suitable to have the mouth wide open and eat too much.
This is the spoon used by men.
You men will sweat when you work.
make the spoon used in eating by men bigger.
It is very important that the work of men will be exposed under the sun.
will have the work of being dare-to-die corps。
What are dare-to-die corps?
Being dare-to-die corps is tiring.
basking in the sun, lumbering, plowing with a hoe
basking in the sun, lumbering, plowing with a hoe, hunting
This is the tool used in the work of men.
These are bow and arrow.
This animal
hunt this animal.
You men. You let go to the field.
You let bask in the sun.
You let plow.
Men will be sneered at.
say this man is a incapable man.
Why let the wife go to the field?
Why let go hunting?
What kind of men are you?
It is exactly like this.
Un, this weaving, this atukadrayane
All the housework is the work of woman.
In the house, woman must take care and teach children.
Woman always dominates: dominating the properties.
It is exactly that their mother is specializing in dominate (all the things.)
(man and woman) can not help each other in woman's work and man's work.
woman can not touch the man's work.
can not touch the machete and spear; can not touch the snare; can not touch the clapping trap.
Woman can not touch this.
If woman touch, you will be destroyed.
The man's tool will be self-disabled.
The item will not be empowered.
If the man touches the work of women,you will become sissy.
you arel not capable in doing everything.
you will not able to hunt.
It is exactly you are in bad luck, just exactly like this.
Why did the Rukai woman in the ancient time use their head to shoulder?
used head-shouldering in order to bring water.
If shoulders heavy, will use head to shoulder.
The meaning is that this woman will not stain her body.
Woman's work can show your laziness, your well-behaving, and your gentleness that woman has.
Whenever woman speaks, should be suppressed.
does not yell.
You are not a man.
Why do become angry?
Woman need to be gentle.
Let yelling become man's
Yelling girls are bad, very bad
Our culture in Rukai is just like this.
facing death and battle is man's job.
So I finished.
Then there is a dog and a frog which he likes.

When we were children in hometown, there are no things to worried and pressure.
The students get together, like family.
In particular, when we were children, my elder siblings... My brother named Takanau. My sister named Lavausu.
When we don't listen, taught us not to do.
They need to learn everyone, and teach junior siblings to...well...sweep.
Teach how to grow taro.
We collect taros, sweet potatoes, and millet, and siblings that get together are wonderful.
Families were in hometown then.
Thank you.
There came a child riding on a bike and he stole one of the baskets and left.
There came three men and helped picking up.
When they left, they passed by the man who was picking mangos.
The old man looked and said maybe they were the ones who took my mango.
But the old man was disappointed, seeing that the three men didn't carry anything.
When we are not seeing things carefully, we usually would mistake others (for something they didn't do).
My saying is about Talrubalringi Taidrengere.
Talrubalringi Taidrengere is very interesting and mysterious.
can not arrive Taidrengere very fast.
Only hunters can arrive the Talrubalringi to hunt.
When arriving the Talrubalringi, there are hunters.
If sneezing or talk loud, the cloud will go down.
If sneezing or talk loud, the cloud will go down to the water level quickly.
(the water level) will wave tremendously, and it is very terrible.
The Talrubalingi, animals are many.
There are muntjacs.
There are boars.
There are many animals here, but if you approch them, all of the animals escape.

In the ranch, my uncle took us to feed the sheep and ride horses.
In the evening, we went to the city to have dinner together.
When we were about to leave, we found that the motorcycle had been stolen, so we had to leave by bus.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
After I went to college, I took a course on aboriginal culture and learned that the aboriginal people in Taiwan have various and rich cultures.
So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in 'oponoho, as well as Paiwan, Bunun and Japanese.
I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is an Paiwan, and he knows many Bunun at work, so he can speak so many languages.
Although we could't fully understand it, we could record it on our cell phones and listen to it more.
When I was young, I didn't understand the culture of my ethnic group, and I was a little embarrassed that I was an aborigine.
The more I know, the more I feel that being a 'oponoho is unique and something to be proud of.
My younger brother is going home this evening.
We passed the vegetable stand, which had a lot of fresh green vegetables.
We bought water spinach, yams and carrots.
The owner of the nearby fruit stand said: "My pineapples and peaches are very sweet. Buy some!"
We bought pineapples and peaches.
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
Grandma thought it was too expensive and asked the boss if it could be cheaper.
After waiting for a long time, it was already dark.
The younger brother called back and said that the army suddenly couldn't take a vacation and would not be back until the next Sunday.
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
I have a classmate named Vaaho, he often forgets to bring things.
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
But he has a bad habit of often borrowing things but not returning them.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
One day, we all went on an outing together.
On the way, Kacaw wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
Vaaho burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
The classmate told him, because you didn't bring it yourself, and you wouldn't return the things lent to you!
The next day at school, Vaaho arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
Vaaho apologized to the students and said that he would definitely bring his own things in the future, and thanked the classmates for their willingness to lend him things before.
My dad is a hunter of the tribe.
When I was little, my dad and uncle would go out at night with hunting knives and guns.
At daybreak, they returned with their prey.

They would divide the prey at the entrance of the village and share it with the tribe.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
Dad said that he would take me with me when I grew up.
The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Dad saw it and told me that I will be a very good hunter in the future.
Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.
Dad said, we want to thank the ancestors for their blessings, so that we have a lot of prey to harvest.

Liucu burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
The classmate told him, because you didn't bring it yourself, and you wouldn't return the things lent to you!
The next day at school, Liucu arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
Liucu apologized to the students and said that he would definitely bring his own things in the future, and thanked the classmates for their willingness to lend him things before.
My dad is a hunter of the tribe.
When I was little, my dad and uncle would go out at night with hunting knives and guns.
At daybreak, they returned with their prey.
Sometimes it was a boar, sometimes a flying squirrel, and occasionally a pheasant.
They would divide the prey at the entrance of the village and share it with the tribe.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
Dad said that he would take me with me when I grew up.
The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.
When returning to the village, share the hunted prey with the tribe.
Dad said, we want to thank the ancestors for their blessings, so that we have a lot of prey to harvest.
I was late for school this morning.
When I was going to school, I forgot to bring my backpack.
I didn't bring anything with me.
During class, I and my classmates read the textbook together.

My good friend's name is Ratage, and he is also an Rukai child.
We often listen to the elders telling stories together, and we both can speak the Rukai proficiently.
I am tall and overweight, while Ratage is short and thin.
Ratage is very energetic, and everyone likes him a lot.
Today was the school's sports day, and the school organized many competitions.
There were tug of war, soccer, running, dancing, and archery.
I participated in the running competition.
When I was running, I fell down, and my knees were bleeding.
But I stood up and continued running forward.
Everyone was happy when I reached the finish line.
Although I didn't get first place, I'm glad because I completed the race.
Yesterday, my father and I visited my uncle.
He fell off the roof while repairing it.
My father brought beef and betel nuts for my uncle.
My uncle and I chatted in the room, and he shared many stories.
Before I left, my uncle praised me for growing taller and becoming more handsome.
I said, "When your foot gets better, come to our house next time and visit us."
I interviewed Kulele Gadhu, a young tribal member who has long been advocating for the inclusion of tribal names on identification cards.
We had arranged to visit his home this holiday for the interview.
During the interview, he introduced to me the origin of his name and also introduced me to his family and tribe.
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
He told me that using Chinese characters could not accurately convey his name, and others would still call him \Ku Xian Sheng
Everyone loved my grandmother's stall. Many people bought the chilis and African eggplants, and many people came to taste the dishes she cooked.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
Our goods sold out quickly, and my grandmother said, \It's all thanks to your help.\""
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
Seeing my grandmother's passion for traditional food, I feel very proud and honored.
I arrived at school at seven today.
It's time for class, the teacher walked into the classroom, and the monitor said: "Stand up! Salute!"
We said loudly, "Hi, teacher."
In class, the teacher taught us the Rukai language of numbers.
We followed the teacher to read, we sang the number song.
I have learned many Rukai languages.
I go to school every day, I learn the Rukai language every day, and I want to tell my mother.
I am 10 years old.
I have a brother, his name is Sakinu, he is 11 years old.
We study in the same school.
Both my brother and I like to sing.
I like swimming. During the holidays, our whole family go swimming together.
I love meeting new people, we can sing and swim together.
Our family lives in Labuwa.
There are five people in our family.
I live with my father, mother, brother and sister.
My father is tall and he is a policeman.
My mother is thin and my mom is a doctor.
My father speaks the Rukai language with us at home.
We will all go back to the tribe during the summer vacation.
My brothers and sisters and I will catch frogs together.
I went out with my mother today.
The sky is blue during the day, the weather is neither cold nor hot, and the wind is cool.
We ate bread on the grass, the sun was shining on us, and it was very warm.
In the afternoon, the sky turned red.
Mom said, maybe the typhoon is coming.
There were no clouds in the sky at night, and the stars came out.
On the way home, I made a wish with the stars
Our school is not big, there are not many students, everyone knows each other.
All the children will gather in the playground, play ball and chat together.
The teachers also play with us, the school is one big family.
We have to clean every day, and everyone has to clean the classroom.
Some people clean the windows, some sweep the floor.
We will also clean every corner of the school. Everyone works together, and the school is very clean every day.
Yesterday, I went to visit my grandpa in the tribe.
We haven't seen each other for a long time and I miss him a lot.
As soon as grandpa saw me, he invited me to eat watermelon and drink tea.
I also like grandpa's tea, it's tasted good too.
At noon, I cooked lunch with my grandma.
Grandma cooked a big lunch, including fish, chicken, pumpkin, and snails.
After lunch, we went to the vegetable garden to pick vegetables.
Today the teacher took us to the zoo, and we lined up at the gate to buy tickets.
After entering the zoo, the teacher said, There are birds in the front and snakes in the back
I'm afraid of snakes, so I don't look at snakes.
I saw a lot of birds flying around in the trees and saw owls sleeping in tree hollows.
There are elephants, horses and tigers in the zoo. I have never seen these animals before. I was really happy to see them today.
I took a lot of pictures and showed them to my parents.
Next time I will come with my parents.
This holiday, my sister and I went to Taitung to visit my uncle.
When we arrived in Taitung, my uncle drove to the station to pick us up.
There is a big ranch near my uncle's house, and we rode bicycles to the ranch together.
In the ranch, my uncle took us to feed the sheep and ride horses.
There are a lot of cars in the city, so we go there by motorcycle.
When we were about to leave, we found that the motorcycle had been stolen, so we had to leave by bus.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
After I went to college, I took a course on aboriginal culture and learned that the aboriginal people in Taiwan have various and rich cultures.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in Rukai, as well as Japanese, Hokkien and English.
I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is an American, and he knows many Chinese at work, so he can speak so many languages.
During our interview, the old man talked about a lot of traditional knowledge about hunting.
Although we could't fully understand it, we could record it on our cell phones and listen to it more.
When I was young, I didn't understand the culture of my ethnic group, and I was a little embarrassed that I was an aborigine.
The more I know, the more I feel that being a Rukai is unique and something to be proud of.
My younger brother is going home this evening.
We passed the vegetable stand, which had a lot of fresh green vegetables.
We bought water spinach, yams and carrots.
The owner of the nearby fruit stand said: "My pineapples and peaches are very sweet. Buy some!"
We bought pineapples and peaches.
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
Grandma thought it was too expensive and asked the boss if it could be cheaper.
But the boss said that it is already very cheap and cannot be reduced any further.
The boss next door said, come and buy my fish, my fish is big and cheap.
In the end we bought chicken and fish, and went home to cook a table of food.
After waiting for a long time, it was already dark.
The younger brother called back and said that the army suddenly couldn't take a vacation and would not be back until the next Sunday.
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
But he has a bad habit of often borrowing things but not returning them.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
One day, we all went on an outing together.
On the way, Kacaw wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
He borrowed toilet paper from his classmates, but everyone told him that I didn't bring them either.
