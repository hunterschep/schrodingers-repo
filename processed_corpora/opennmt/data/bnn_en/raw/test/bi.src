<2bnn> There were tug of war, soccer, running, dancing, and archery.

<2bnn> We said loudly, "Hi, teacher."

<2bnn> We will also clean every corner of the school. Everyone works together, and the school is very clean every day.

<2bnn> I said goodbye to them and said I'd see them next time.
<2en> Mapising aak ivot, paqpon nii aak sadoo ivot.
<2bnn> I'm afraid of snakes, so I don't look at snakes.
<2en> zako siin bai monhaan babalivan tolkok, palhanos mapit'ia paitosanavan na pakaon i masinaoba-nanaz.
<2bnn> My grandma and I went to the market to buy chickens and prepared a delicious dinner for my younger brother.

<2bnn> Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.

<2bnn> I didn't bring anything with me.
<2en> Maqi tindakol aak a, motingkol aak, madia pisqaidang haan qaa.
<2bnn> When I was running, I fell down, and my knees were bleeding.

<2en> mais isnavaan hai, simol sian aloszangan mas ispapatas, ishahaishais siin ahil.

<2bnn> My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
<2en> cis'oni to na'asa ma'aipi taskon mas madadaingaz hanop, paha kaopahanian a saikin tatanam malka'aho, zaav a inaak sinpal'aho cisdoan mas cici.

<2bnn> Both my brother and I like to sing.
<2en> hahima cam tastolomaq.
<2bnn> There are five people in our family.
<2en> ihan molomaq to dan, topaon zako ka bintoqan to.
<2bnn> On the way home, I made a wish with the stars
<2en> amin na ovava'az si'anpok han deseq, moskon pismali', moskon pababazbaz.
<2bnn> All the children will gather in the playground, play ball and chat together.
<2en> moskon amin na sinsi' zami paqaqenan, maszang nga kako' tastolomaq.
<2bnn> The teachers also play with us, the school is one big family.

<2bnn> Next time I will come with my parents.
<2en> heza madaing sepokan sinepok han ngalan lomaq pantama'on, tincozinsa' cam mon'ita.
<2bnn> There is a big ranch near my uncle's house, and we rode bicycles to the ranch together.
<2en> ihan nam tamazo'an na lomaq to ova'azng, panto'in na molosqo' cam monhan Taicio', civong ihan baq miqomic.
<2bnn> When we were young, our family lived in tamazu'an. After I started school, we moved to Taichung and have been living in the city ever since.
<2en> pangqa, mato pal'o'on haip qamisan, dosa cak ki masitoqas nak monhan acang macingav madadengaz, na'asa maqanciap anak'anak sidoq to iniqomican.
<2bnn> So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
<2en> kinozin mabaliv cam tolkok mabaliv amin iskan, molomaq mahanat tas'a pangka isqol.
<2bnn> In the end we bought chicken and fish, and went home to cook a table of food.

<2bnn> We invited friends and family to have a great dinner together.

<2bnn> I have a classmate named Kimat, he often forgets to bring things.
<2en> tangicin na Kimat, mahao' naip topa to "makoa amo tona amin nito pasimol zako haqel isqesqes!"
<2bnn> Kimat burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
<2en> maqe tosqangin na, mama' nai pinanaq tesmomot.
<2bnn> At daybreak, they returned with their prey.
<2en> mato soqesin mo'acang nano pavazonin nai ka bahi' nai, na'ispaqosil li tec'an.
<2bnn> They would divide the prey at the entrance of the village and share it with the tribe.
<2en> kinga'in isnava'an, isnava'an cam sinsi' malasbonon masipol sipolon.
<2bnn> In class, the teacher taught us the Bunun language of numbers.
<2en> oka' nak inadas mazmaz.
<2bnn> I didn't bring anything with me.

<2bnn> He told me that using Chinese characters could not accurately convey his name, and others would still call him \Di Xian Sheng
<2en> minihan sinkokoza di, oqancepan cak itocia bonon ismot cin kokonon to qanciap, moso to oqancepan ni icia babalivan to ineqdi'an.
<2bnn> Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
<2en> sado ki qodasno'an malkacia itobonon kokonon to qanciap, mastan cak matomaceqeng onaskalan.
<2bnn> Seeing my grandmother's passion for traditional food, I feel very proud and honored.

<2bnn> We said loudly, "Hi, teacher."
<2en> Asa azak it toqasnanaz naak tosasaoc.

<2en> Nii' to daqvisan is ol'oanlaihlih ca lomaq it pantamaon naak, podaan tokoc is laihlih a kaca'anin ta'.

<2en> Macingavak cia ha maqanciapin to, taoloo ca binanao'az cia, madia' sala ca poot pacqalan ha'an kokoza'an cia, daqat madia' ca qalingaz qancaipon cia bazbaz.
<2bnn> I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is an Chinese, and he knows many Hokkien at work, so he can speak so many languages.
<2en> Mabaliv azam is onglai ciin qalop.
<2bnn> We bought pineapples and peaches.
<2en> Bazbaz ca ingalan a taimicia to, noqan mabaliv is kaan inaak i', mamasqa' ca kaan naak nii' amin to maqlic.
<2bnn> The boss next door said, come and buy my fish, my fish is big and cheap.

<2bnn> My dad is a hunter of the tribe.
<2en> Maqanciap amin makohaqo madamos tismomoot ca taka'acang a bananaz, maqanciap a nai matas'is haqodoon ciin malaqato'.
<2bnn> The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
<2en> Qalto nii' to lavai', ooto mantan azak manahip sala, maopa'i saonaqtongan zako ca palontan dii.
<2bnn> Although I didn't get first place, I'm glad because I completed the race.

<2en> Moskon azak it pantamaon naak iha'an sabaqan pababazbaz, taqo ka cia madia' sala ka qaiqabasan to qalinga.
<2bnn> My uncle and I chatted in the room, and he shared many stories.

<2bnn> I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
