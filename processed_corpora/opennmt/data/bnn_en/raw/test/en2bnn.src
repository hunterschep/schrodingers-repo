During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
The classmate told him, because you didn't bring it yourself, and you wouldn't return the things lent to you!
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.
We study together in the Nansalu tribe.
There were tug of war, soccer, running, dancing, and archery.
Everyone was happy when I reached the finish line.
My name is Tiang.
I am 10 years old.
Both my brother and I like to sing.
There are five people in our family.
On the way home, I made a wish with the stars
All the children will gather in the playground, play ball and chat together.
The teachers also play with us, the school is one big family.
Next time I will come with my parents.
There is a big ranch near my uncle's house, and we rode bicycles to the ranch together.
When we were young, our family lived in tamazu'an. After I started school, we moved to Taichung and have been living in the city ever since.
So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
In the end we bought chicken and fish, and went home to cook a table of food.
We invited friends and family to have a great dinner together.
I have a classmate named Kimat, he often forgets to bring things.
Kimat burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
At daybreak, they returned with their prey.
They would divide the prey at the entrance of the village and share it with the tribe.
In class, the teacher taught us the Bunun language of numbers.
I didn't bring anything with me.
My uncle injured his foot.
He told me that using Chinese characters could not accurately convey his name, and others would still call him \Di Xian Sheng
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
Seeing my grandmother's passion for traditional food, I feel very proud and honored.
We said loudly, "Hi, teacher."
Both my brother and I like to sing.
I like swimming. During the holidays, our whole family go swimming together.
My brothers and sisters and I will catch frogs together.
I went out with my mother today.
The teachers also play with us, the school is one big family.
There are elephants, horses and tigers in the zoo. I have never seen these animals before. I was really happy to see them today.
The station is not far from my uncle's house, and it's just a short drive away.
I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is an Chinese, and he knows many Hokkien at work, so he can speak so many languages.
We bought pineapples and peaches.
The boss next door said, come and buy my fish, my fish is big and cheap.
After waiting for a long time, it was already dark.
The next day at school, Qanciaz arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
My dad is a hunter of the tribe.
The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
Although I didn't get first place, I'm glad because I completed the race.
My uncle injured his foot.
My uncle and I chatted in the room, and he shared many stories.
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
