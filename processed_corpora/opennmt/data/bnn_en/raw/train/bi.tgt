President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
Cai-Ing-Un contong daihio siho taho to moliva siho malka Incomin
On this day 22 years ago, the term "shanbao" (mountain people) in the Additional Articles of our Constitution was replaced with the proper name: "indigenous people." This correction not only did away with a discriminatory term, but also highlighted the status of indigenous peoples as Taiwan's "original owners." From this basis, today, we are taking another step forward. To all indigenous peoples of Taiwan: On behalf of the government, I express to you our deepest apology. For the four centuries of pain and mistreatment you have endured, I apologize to you on behalf of the government.
Isia maposanhan-dosa painsanan tanangaos to aip to hanian, imita sinosan to kimpo, maza ‹ sanpao › hai paciloshoan to ‹ Incomin ›. Sain to sinpacilosho hai, mapin-okain maisna habas to sinsatamal, mapithasin taho to kata Incomin sidoh hai, nao to taini Taioantan. Kanasaicin, aip to hanian, nakaslod kata modan. Nadaihio saikin seho, masina sia Incomin sidoh, maisna isang topa to moliva sasaipok. Pat saba painsanancin, kamo hai malmimihdi mosaso kahaingion, daihio saikin sasaipok topa to: Totoza seho to moliva sinmalka mo.
I know that even now, there are some around us who see no need to apologize. But that is the most important reason why I am representing the government to issue this apology today. To see what was unfair in the past as a matter of course, or to treat the pain of other ethnic peoples as an unavoidable part of human development, this is the first mindset that we, standing here today, resolve to change and overturn.
Latoza saikin to, sao aip to hanian, oskonanta mihomis mandidingalan to bonon hai, aizang bonon iniliskinan maingo to okas moliva. Cissaicin, aip to hanian asa saikin to daihio seho topang to moliva sinsaipok. Taisbananin to painlivan hai samaszangan mas nao to namaopacia, anis doma sidoh to inihdian hai, makas-ang to nao to nalahaip saicin. Cissaicin, matodoldol saikin aip to hanian saincin, naasa kangaos kahna mapaokbas iniliskinan.
The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Holanda mas Consonkong hai maipalatpo mapataz at maihalav mas Tangavolan sidoh, masa mailngangaos Liponto to seho hai, pailkapataz abdit, masa sin Lipon saipok hai, kaspokanin sana naicia saipok, masa pailkanahtongin pasampanah hai sin Taolotan saipok hai, mavaiviin sinsaipok Incomin sidoh. Isia pat saba to painsanan, kain-asang, mahalav dalah, mahalav Incomis to kinli. Cismaopacia, daihio saikin seho masinasia Incomin sidoh topa to moliva sain.
Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Kanasia Incomin sidoh sia maisnahabas to dailaz saipok asang malka-minihomis. Haito, isia namapinsial kokkacin, nin Incomin sidoh mahto salin-anak. Montonohin maisnakitngab to dailaz, itoskon to iniliskinan hai, nin amin saaopancia. Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Incomin sidoh topa to moliva seho malka bonon.
Indigenous peoples had their own languages. However, with Japanese rule aiming to assimilate and turn all into imperial subjects, and with the ROC government banning tribal languages after 1945, indigenous peoples' languages suffered great losses. Most Pingpu languages have disappeared. Successive governments have been negligent in the protection of indigenous cultures. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Naoto aizan Incomin sidoh mas halinga, maisna isnavan min Lipon to sinnava, isia 1945 painsanan kitngab, lahnot seho malas-bonon, at maszang monghano ito Incomin sidoh haling. Sopahin Tangavolan sidoh niin haiap malas-ananak to halinga palinoto. Maisna habas to seho, ni to masanbot mapalmamaopa Incomis sidoh maisna kitngab to bongka. Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Incomin sidoh topa to moliva seho malka bonon.
Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.
Vaivi sidoh kaosia Taioancin, takisia ohaivas vali to Tangavolan hai, lanadan mas iahdi. Maza lasasais kan-asang hai mapis-oka inaicia to sidoh. Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Tangavolan topa to moliva seho malka mo.
After the democratic transition, the country began to respond to the appeals of indigenous movements. The government made certain promises and efforts. Today, we have an Indigenous Peoples Basic Law that is quite advanced. However, government agencies have not given sufficient weight to this law. Our actions have not been fast enough, comprehensive enough or sound enough. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Masa min-onin minsio kokka, taiaza mas Incomin sidoh ondo to sintotopa. Seho hai aintalam malmanano to napin-sialon. Aizan kata mas "Incomin sidoh to kanadan," haito ni seho kapimaopa kozakoza sahosbo samashing saicin. Malaitaz kaimin, ni to macitpong, ni to mapal-amin. Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Incomin topa to moliva seho malka bonon.
Taiwan is known as a culturally diverse society. But even today, indicators on health, education, economic livelihood, political participation and more still show gaps between indigenous and non- indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, stereotypes and even discrimination against indigenous peoples have not gone away. The government has not done enough, so indigenous peoples have suffered pain and frustration unknown to other ethnic peoples. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Topaon Taioan to "maisopah bongka" to katdan. Haito, saolaopako, Incomin sidoh to kaihatban, ispasnava, kaisoian, iapavcin to isasaipok, mapasidahdah mas ni to Incomin. Mosaso, maldaok to samakong sakolaz Incomin sidoh. Kaoman seho kinozkozan, oka doma sidoh minaopa mas Incomin sidoh to lainihaiban, inihdian sinmas tailpatazan. Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Incomin sidoh topa to moliva seho malka bonon.
Our efforts have fallen short, and succeeding generations have been blind to this inadequacy. Because of this, your hardship has continued to this day. For this we are truly sorry. Today's apology is long overdue, but it is a beginning. I do not expect any one speech or phrase of apology to wipe away four centuries of pain and suffering by the indigenous peoples. But I do hope with all my heart that today's apology will set this country and all its people on the path towards reconciliation.
Kaoman inam kinozkozan, maisna habas ni kaimin minhaiap at mailmanano, kazin kamo sao laopako maldaok to malmimihdi, tozatoza to moliva maopacia. Aip to hanian topa to moliva, anatopa to maaitin topa, haito sain hai kangab. Ni saikin makasang to maza ito Incomin sidoh sia pat saba painsanan to inihdian hai, nacis-oni tasa to paitasan, tosan topa to moliva at paladoazin mas painliavan. Haito maisna isang saikin mastatala natopa to moliva, aopa sain hai tasto-kokka to bonon mapaladoaz to kitngab.
Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
Namakosia saikin Incomin sidoh to taiklas, mapishaiap aip to sinkozakoza. Taialo to haling, "mamantok" hai Balay. "patohavit" hai Sbalay, kaz Balay to tanangaos sosan mas S. Maza mamantok mas patohavit hai, maitasa to halingaz. Sintopa to, mamantok to patohavit, asa to maisna isang samantok to maimakoa dao at namahto minsia.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
Isia Incomin sidoh to bongka, mais aiza bonon panliva malka doma to bonon, mais asa mapaladoaz, maza madadaingaz hai mas-anpok naicia. Ni to tosansan topa to moliva, asa naia to patopaon mas anak- anak to iniliskinan. Mais tonahtongin amin at mapasohisin haling hai, mapahod madadaingaz naicia mas davos, taisbanan to painlivan hai toza to paladoazin. Saicin topaon to Sbalay.
I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.
Mashadang saikin aip to hanian, maza seho mas Incomin sidoh to Sbalay. Ni saikin maming mas taisbanan to painlivan, sinmas maimakoa. Natopa amin sanganin Incomin sidoh mas iniliskinan. Ni saikin topa to macinso a ladoaz. Haito, mahtoang kata mastala akitmatan, habas to painlivan hai naniin mohna, aiza to hanian, sain to kokka hai namamantok to maiaopa mapaladoaz.
Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
Aip to hanian hai kangab, mapaladoaz to iskozakoza hai, ni to sia Incomin sidoh sinmas Tangavolan, siamas ito seho to nakozakozaon. Haiap saikin to mais kaz makongolos topa to moliva hai kaomanang. Maisna laopako ito seho sinmalko Incomin sidoh hai, nasaitan mahto kanadan mas kokkatan mapaladoaz.
Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
Isaincin saikin mapishaiap to, isia Contongho hai namapin-aiza "Incomin sidoh mantok to likisi mas mokbas mapiszang to iingkai." Makoonisaikinkokkatotanghapopaliskadanto ngan mas-anpok, moskon sidohsidoh sinihailaz to bonon Namapaloszang palihansiap kokka alngangasan to nakozakozaon.
I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.
Mapihosbo saikin topa to, isia contongho to iingkai hai nakastanan sahosbo hai, kokka mas Incomin sidoh to mapaloszang. Sidohsidoh to sihailazon hai, nakanasia sidoh mas asang itoskon to sinpatopa. Sain hai ito sidoh itoskon to sinpalihansiap, mahto mapatopa maisna isang to iniliskinan.
In addition, I will request that our Executive Yuan convene regularly the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law Promotion Committee, and use the Yuan's authority to coordinate and handle matters related to any consensus reached by the above-mentioned commission. These matters include the following: to retrieve historical memories, to promote indigenous self-government, to seek fair economic development, to ensure continuation of culture and education, to safeguard indigenous health, and to protect the rights of urban indigenous peoples, etc.
Aizang, naiskalonanko sincongin to madailaza oanpokan to hanian palioni "Incomin sidoh kanadan to dailaz." Iingkai itoskon to sinpatopa, maza ima to Ing mapatopa to napikon mapinsia. Maszang mas masolot kilim taikihabasang, lainson Incomin sidoh to salin-anak, mapiszang is-ihomis, mas-ono pasnava sinmas mapantala bongka, mapihatba lotbo, sinmas saipok taosia bokzav to bonon.
Where modern laws and indigenous traditional cultures are at odds, we will set up an Indigenous Legal Service Center with a high degree of cultural sensitivity, to reduce through institutional design the growing clashes between indigenous customs and modern laws.
Laopako ispakapimaopa to dailaz mas Incomin sidoh mailanhabas to bongka, aiza ni to patokdado, nasihaizaz kata mas mahansiap bongka to bonon masingadah "mindangaz Incomin sidoh malka ispakapimaopa dailaz," kabahlo mas nakanadan, mapis-oka Incomin sidoh to mailanhabas to dailaz sinmas palatongtong laopako kokka kanadan to dailaz.
I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.
Naiskalonanko malkasia to macinsoa kozakoza, Incomin sidoh mais cis-oni mailanhabas to dalaz, isia kaitdadan to dalah, cisoni naikanakon ni to isbaliv at mapataz ni to mahto patazon to takilibos, at damon sisaisan iksobon. Namoskon kata palihansiap to napasikon mapoltav.
I will also direct relevant agencies to present an investigative report on the decision-making process of nuclear waste storage on Orchid Island. Before finding a permanent solution for the nuclear waste, we will provide the Yami tribe appropriate compensation.

At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.

On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.

Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.

To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.

I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.

In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.

I call upon our entire society to come together and get to know our history, get to know our land, and get to know the cultures of our many ethnic peoples. Let us work towards reconciliation, a shared existence and shared prosperity, and a new future for Taiwan.

Then there's only the dog looking up and calling for it.

The two of them went together, calling out loud and looking around.

It was not there. Then in the forest they saw there was a hornet nest on the tree.

The dog wanted to climb up the whole time to eat the hornet nest.

He kept on looking if the frog was inside.
masisivit a dii a ingadah cia sisioh hai.
That dog wants to eat the hornets.

But the child was afraid. What should he do if he is chased since it suddenly knows?
hai miko in a mapising a ovaaz a hai mais cinhaiap hai na kasinapon.
It was pulled down... Look, suddenly they all turned their heads - those hornets that would eat us were just coming out from the nest which had dropped down.

Would he hide in that forest? Was there a wall?

He would be chased by the hornets.

Everybody was afraid over there and kept waiting and screaming "where is our mom?"

The dog was chased because he had taken down.

As for the children, who kicked him?

Who had kicked it?
mmm hai ma bi s kandondah.
It was the owl, right?
mmm ithoo tan.
It was kicked by the owl, right?

Then all the young people went there and tried their best to cover their head. How would it be if the hornets came? Just this way.
at minnadii askadiip amin mindoav kanano dii a mapa'ia bongo to na mikoa mais minsoma pahosaz ka.
He was still calling but still it wasn't there. Then it was deer's antlers - the deer came out.

Will it help him?

Then how would the dog that is already on the other side get there?

To there, there were two birds and a nest, an empty nest.

Then, on the contrary, the dog was saved by being held on his head.

The frog still hadn't come out yet.

Here, did the frog come out?

Here, the dog came out from the water and it was told not to speak because there would be frogs.

Then here (on this page), the dog came out. Would it pull out frogs there?

He kept looking over there, wondering if the frog would appear.
mmm adii masisivit to na minsoma sisioh.
Then he told the dog not to bark or howl.

Then there, they went on the wood.

They became very happy because he and many children, siblings and the like were there.

The dog believed whether it was still inside.

Then it went down from the window.

Then the bottle broke.

We can see the child goes there.

He was really sad.

He immediately went down.

And they went outside holding the dog.

And kept calling and kept on searching.

He kept calling outside, but

So they kept calling to the, uhm.

The dog and the child kept calling out to the frog.

They all flew out.

So we can see this hole, then call out.

Then that dog sees the hive of the hornets.

And then it is barking and calling out loud.

woofwoof woofwoof woof woof
'oang'oang 'oang'oang 'oang 'oang.
"Are you in there, frog?"

He kept on shouting

He startled.

Did this mouse come from this hole?

that mouse, it almost looks like a field mouse.

Very small.

He is on the tree.

on the tree.
adadaza sia lokis a hai.
There is a, it looks like it's called, the hornets.

The dog keeps barking at them.
maldaok a aso dii lalonglong.
He barks "woof woof woof woof."
lalonglong to L2'oang'oang L2'oang'oang.
It was like that.

Was that dog like that?

It is holding the tree, and keeps on barking.

No! He is barking at the hornets.

He doesn't know, the hornet's nest will falls down the ground.

Then, because the child sees that tree, that

There is that hole.

On it he sees.

So the frog sees the tree, there is that hole.

Then the kid climbs up the tree and sees a hole on the tree.

The kid goes up and yells at the hole.

That dog just made the beehive drop.
ong at maza dii aso a hai halhalon saicia sangan maza dii ai ai bohosaz.
So the dog is running away chased by hornets.

That kid drops down to the ground because seeing the owl.
maza dii ovaaz a hai cinghoza to sado mas ithoo aopa sian maz to hazam cinghoza hai ka maisisia lokis mohalhal pastak to nasto.
Then there is a rock as well as something like a tree. However, it seems to be deer's antlers when being watched carefully.

That dog hides. Because being chased by the hornets, it hides under the rock.

That kid is on the rock, holding the horn-like things.

Maybe the goat does not know where it is running is a cliff.

It stops, and the kind and dog drops from the antler down to the ground- it seems to be water.

He drops into the water and sits there. He stands up right away and carries the dog on his back.

He wants to go to the riverside.

When he goes to the riverside, there is a dead tree.

They hold the tree.
ong ong at aopa saia hai ai naia hai talidikos naia lokis cia aopa.
The tree seems to be a hole.
at aopa ai ong at aopa maza dii lokis a hai mazang mas laak aopa hai.
The kid worries things like that they have yelled out loud and scared the bird might happen again, so he tells the dog to be quiet.

They cross and see, and they are shocked.
ong at aopa ai daongkav naia hai ai sado naia to ai at kaz cinhoza naia to ai via to aiza.
He thinks it is good! It turns out that the frog is not lost.

He takes the frog he kept home.

Nine frogs remain now. There used to be ten.

The kid takes one home.

There are dead trees near the riverside. Frogs also like to live at the dead trees at the riverside.

There is a kid who found a frog and kept it.

He also has a dog.

They became a family.

They love the frog so much. They are a family. One night they are sleeping.

"Where is the frog?," the dog keeps searching and barking.
a osa maz a sisioh a maopa cia amin aso a to kikilim a lalonglong to isa maz a sisioh.
They hug each other and consider where the frog went.
ong hai a miliskin naia to ai na koisa dii sisioh a maopa cia to mapatoaliba naia.
He says to the dog: 'We are going to look for the frog. I have no idea if it is taken away.'
topaon saicia aso a to na kodiip kata kilim mas to sisioh cia nii to haipon to ka aiza antaban mikoa.
They went outside, went everywhere, went to the river

there is a tree where they live

There is a hole there. Then the child thinks if it hid in the hole.
aiza ang mai sia laak at maopa cia ovaaz a miliskin to haipa nii to tongnangadah saia laak cia.
Over there he keeps calling: "Frog where are you?"
idii saia malala'la to sisioh isa kaso.
Then, that dog sees the hornet's nest in the tree.
ong at maz a aso hai osadoan mas isia lokis to sia ito bahosaz to sia lomah.
He wonders, is the frog in there, too?
miliskin saia to isain cia amin a sisioh at.
Then the tree was shaken. He didn't know the hornets will fly out when being shaken.
at vohvohon a maz a sia to lokis a at nii to haiap to bahosaz a hai mais vohvohon naia hai na mon'apav macisbai.
The dog hits the hornets to the ground.
isia mavohvoh to sia aso cin hai kalinastoon kaliomanon maz a sia to bahosaz a lananasto at.
I think the dog would be taken and bitten.

The hornets move that way to chase the dog, and then the child hides at the tree.

The hunter who hunted with a dog became a bird named Dut.
mapoaso to bonon hai min'oni mas hazam topaon to Doot to hazam.
Long time a ago, there was a greatly brave hunter.
masa habas ang aiza dao a mamanano to mamangan mais hanop.
It is because when hunting with a dog, a brave dog is required to help hunters chase the game.
aopa mais mapoaso hai asa to aiza maz a mamangan a maz a sia aso a mindangaz mas bonon cia masinap mas ai takilibos to minihomis.
There was a brave man who was never left behind when going dog-hunting with others.

When hunting, he caught preys the most.

He was able to get more game because he was excellent.

However since his dog kept barking while approaching the other side, he knew that the dog was chasing a big wild boar because it barked without stopping.
ong hai mikoi maz a isaicia aso hai manadidiip to oskatasipal lolonglong at haiap saia to maz a aso hai masinap ang mas vanis daingaz oa macimanano lolonglong.
Then, 'Tu tu tu tu tu tu,' the hunter called the dog back.

Talum let it go, taking the net bag on his back and left for home.

While continuing to call the dog, Talum the Brave arrived home.

His dog did not follow him, and did not come back either.
ai sado saia to oka aso kinkikinoz saicia oka amin makoslavi saicia minsoma.
His wife and children answered: 'NO.'
antalam a pingaz mas ovaaz to oka.
Then Talum the brave was considering why the dog did not come after?

He remembered that he had heard the dog barking when he was leaving.

He kept calling in the mountain despite that the sky turned dark.

However, he could not go back if the dog was not found.

The day broke.

Talum the Brave got on the tree, keeping calling and looking for his dog a whole day. However, no dog came.

Three days passed, the dog that he had been looking for did not come back.

He kept calling, without eating and sleeping. Yet the dog did not come back.

Talum the Brave was so sad. He missed the dog very much, the dog he treasured the most.

In the tree he became very sad of a sudden, wondering what should he do.

He was weak on the tree, and then he died.

Then indeed the cousins went to the mountain where Talum usually goes to.

No answers thought.

They went uphill. They looked up, seeing something kept crying 'duduut' in the tree.

Then they looked upward and wondered what was crying 'Duduut'.

Oh! They saw a big bird kept crying 'DUDUUT' on the branch.

Maybe he said:

It can be seen that that child is not very greedy.

Because the three of them, if we were to look at it, that child could, help them take the hat, if they were asking for it.
