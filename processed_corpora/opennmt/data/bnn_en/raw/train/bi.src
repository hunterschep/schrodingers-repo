<2bnn> President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
<2en> Isia maposanhan-dosa painsanan tanangaos to aip to hanian, imita sinosan to kimpo, maza ‹ sanpao › hai paciloshoan to ‹ Incomin ›. Sain to sinpacilosho hai, mapin-okain maisna habas to sinsatamal, mapithasin taho to kata Incomin sidoh hai, nao to taini Taioantan. Kanasaicin, aip to hanian, nakaslod kata modan.

Pat saba painsanancin, kamo hai malmimihdi mosaso kahaingion, daihio saikin sasaipok topa to: Totoza seho to moliva sinmalka mo.
<2bnn> On this day 22 years ago, the term "shanbao" (mountain people) in the Additional Articles of our Constitution was replaced with the proper name: "indigenous people." This correction not only did away with a discriminatory term, but also highlighted the status of indigenous peoples as Taiwan's "original owners." From this basis, today, we are taking another step forward. To all indigenous peoples of Taiwan: On behalf of the government, I express to you our deepest apology. For the four centuries of pain and mistreatment you have endured, I apologize to you on behalf of the government.
<2en> Latoza saikin to, sao aip to hanian, oskonanta mihomis mandidingalan to bonon hai, aizang bonon iniliskinan maingo to okas moliva. Cissaicin, aip to hanian asa saikin to daihio seho topang to moliva sinsaipok.

Cissaicin, matodoldol saikin aip to hanian saincin, naasa kangaos kahna mapaokbas iniliskinan.
<2bnn> I know that even now, there are some around us who see no need to apologize. But that is the most important reason why I am representing the government to issue this apology today. To see what was unfair in the past as a matter of course, or to treat the pain of other ethnic peoples as an unavoidable part of human development, this is the first mindset that we, standing here today, resolve to change and overturn.
<2en> Holanda mas Consonkong hai maipalatpo mapataz at maihalav mas Tangavolan sidoh, masa mailngangaos Liponto to seho hai, pailkapataz abdit, masa sin Lipon saipok hai, kaspokanin sana naicia saipok, masa pailkanahtongin pasampanah hai sin Taolotan saipok hai, mavaiviin sinsaipok Incomin sidoh.

<2bnn> The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
<2en> Kanasia Incomin sidoh sia maisnahabas to dailaz saipok asang malka-minihomis. Haito, isia namapinsial kokkacin, nin Incomin sidoh mahto salin-anak.

<2bnn> Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
<2en> Naoto aizan Incomin sidoh mas halinga, maisna isnavan min Lipon to sinnava, isia 1945 painsanan kitngab, lahnot seho malas-bonon, at maszang monghano ito Incomin sidoh haling.

Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Incomin sidoh topa to moliva seho malka bonon.
<2bnn> Indigenous peoples had their own languages. However, with Japanese rule aiming to assimilate and turn all into imperial subjects, and with the ROC government banning tribal languages after 1945, indigenous peoples' languages suffered great losses. Most Pingpu languages have disappeared. Successive governments have been negligent in the protection of indigenous cultures. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
<2en> Vaivi sidoh kaosia Taioancin, takisia ohaivas vali to Tangavolan hai, lanadan mas iahdi. Maza lasasais kan-asang hai mapis-oka inaicia to sidoh. Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Tangavolan topa to moliva seho malka mo.
<2bnn> Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.
<2en> Masa min-onin minsio kokka, taiaza mas Incomin sidoh ondo to sintotopa. Seho hai aintalam malmanano to napin-sialon.

Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Incomin topa to moliva seho malka bonon.
<2bnn> After the democratic transition, the country began to respond to the appeals of indigenous movements. The government made certain promises and efforts. Today, we have an Indigenous Peoples Basic Law that is quite advanced. However, government agencies have not given sufficient weight to this law. Our actions have not been fast enough, comprehensive enough or sound enough. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
<2en> Topaon Taioan to "maisopah bongka" to katdan. Haito, saolaopako, Incomin sidoh to kaihatban, ispasnava, kaisoian, iapavcin to isasaipok, mapasidahdah mas ni to Incomin.

Cismaopacia, daihio saikin mas seho masiaopa sia Incomin sidoh topa to moliva seho malka bonon.
<2bnn> Taiwan is known as a culturally diverse society. But even today, indicators on health, education, economic livelihood, political participation and more still show gaps between indigenous and non- indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, stereotypes and even discrimination against indigenous peoples have not gone away. The government has not done enough, so indigenous peoples have suffered pain and frustration unknown to other ethnic peoples. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
<2en> Kaoman inam kinozkozan, maisna habas ni kaimin minhaiap at mailmanano, kazin kamo sao laopako maldaok to malmimihdi, tozatoza to moliva maopacia.

Haito maisna isang saikin mastatala natopa to moliva, aopa sain hai tasto-kokka to bonon mapaladoaz to kitngab.
<2bnn> Our efforts have fallen short, and succeeding generations have been blind to this inadequacy. Because of this, your hardship has continued to this day. For this we are truly sorry. Today's apology is long overdue, but it is a beginning. I do not expect any one speech or phrase of apology to wipe away four centuries of pain and suffering by the indigenous peoples. But I do hope with all my heart that today's apology will set this country and all its people on the path towards reconciliation.
<2en> Namakosia saikin Incomin sidoh to taiklas, mapishaiap aip to sinkozakoza. Taialo to haling, "mamantok" hai Balay. "patohavit" hai Sbalay, kaz Balay to tanangaos sosan mas S. Maza mamantok mas patohavit hai, maitasa to halingaz. Sintopa to, mamantok to patohavit, asa to maisna isang samantok to maimakoa dao at namahto minsia.
<2bnn> Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
<2en> Isia Incomin sidoh to bongka, mais aiza bonon panliva malka doma to bonon, mais asa mapaladoaz, maza madadaingaz hai mas-anpok naicia. Ni to tosansan topa to moliva, asa naia to patopaon mas anak- anak to iniliskinan. Mais tonahtongin amin at mapasohisin haling hai, mapahod madadaingaz naicia mas davos, taisbanan to painlivan hai toza to paladoazin. Saicin topaon to Sbalay.
<2bnn> In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
<2en> Mashadang saikin aip to hanian, maza seho mas Incomin sidoh to Sbalay. Ni saikin maming mas taisbanan to painlivan, sinmas maimakoa. Natopa amin sanganin Incomin sidoh mas iniliskinan. Ni saikin topa to macinso a ladoaz. Haito, mahtoang kata mastala akitmatan, habas to painlivan hai naniin mohna, aiza to hanian, sain to kokka hai namamantok to maiaopa mapaladoaz.
<2bnn> I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.
<2en> Aip to hanian hai kangab, mapaladoaz to iskozakoza hai, ni to sia Incomin sidoh sinmas Tangavolan, siamas ito seho to nakozakozaon. Haiap saikin to mais kaz makongolos topa to moliva hai kaomanang. Maisna laopako ito seho sinmalko Incomin sidoh hai, nasaitan mahto kanadan mas kokkatan mapaladoaz.
<2bnn> Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
<2en> Isaincin saikin mapishaiap to, isia Contongho hai namapin-aiza "Incomin sidoh mantok to likisi mas mokbas mapiszang to iingkai." Makoonisaikinkokkatotanghapopaliskadanto ngan mas-anpok, moskon sidohsidoh sinihailaz to bonon Namapaloszang palihansiap kokka alngangasan to nakozakozaon.
<2bnn> Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
<2en> Mapihosbo saikin topa to, isia contongho to iingkai hai nakastanan sahosbo hai, kokka mas Incomin sidoh to mapaloszang. Sidohsidoh to sihailazon hai, nakanasia sidoh mas asang itoskon to sinpatopa. Sain hai ito sidoh itoskon to sinpalihansiap, mahto mapatopa maisna isang to iniliskinan.
<2bnn> I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.
<2en> Aizang, naiskalonanko sincongin to madailaza oanpokan to hanian palioni "Incomin sidoh kanadan to dailaz." Iingkai itoskon to sinpatopa, maza ima to Ing mapatopa to napikon mapinsia.

<2bnn> In addition, I will request that our Executive Yuan convene regularly the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law Promotion Committee, and use the Yuan's authority to coordinate and handle matters related to any consensus reached by the above-mentioned commission. These matters include the following: to retrieve historical memories, to promote indigenous self-government, to seek fair economic development, to ensure continuation of culture and education, to safeguard indigenous health, and to protect the rights of urban indigenous peoples, etc.
<2en> Laopako ispakapimaopa to dailaz mas Incomin sidoh mailanhabas to bongka, aiza ni to patokdado, nasihaizaz kata mas mahansiap bongka to bonon masingadah "mindangaz Incomin sidoh malka ispakapimaopa dailaz," kabahlo mas nakanadan, mapis-oka Incomin sidoh to mailanhabas to dailaz sinmas palatongtong laopako kokka kanadan to dailaz.
<2bnn> Where modern laws and indigenous traditional cultures are at odds, we will set up an Indigenous Legal Service Center with a high degree of cultural sensitivity, to reduce through institutional design the growing clashes between indigenous customs and modern laws.
<2en> Naiskalonanko malkasia to macinsoa kozakoza, Incomin sidoh mais cis-oni mailanhabas to dalaz, isia kaitdadan to dalah, cisoni naikanakon ni to isbaliv at mapataz ni to mahto patazon to takilibos, at damon sisaisan iksobon. Namoskon kata palihansiap to napasikon mapoltav.
<2bnn> I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.
<2en> Natopaonko amin malkasisia to, minikoa dao mavail dingki-taki maponsia Lan-i, asa to mapithas ispishaiap. Mais okang nasaohabas vailan mas dingki-taka hai, asa Pankalkalan sidoh to saisan.
<2bnn> I will also direct relevant agencies to present an investigative report on the decision-making process of nuclear waste storage on Orchid Island. Before finding a permanent solution for the nuclear waste, we will provide the Yami tribe appropriate compensation.

<2bnn> At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.
<2en> Painsanancin to 11 boan 1 hanian, nakitngab kata kozakoza, mapishaiap kaitdadan Incomin sidoh to dalah.

<2bnn> On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.

<2bnn> Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.

<2bnn> To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.
<2en> Matonaskal saikin mas iskaopakaopa to Incomin kaviaz, mo maipinkailas kokkacin iskaopakaopa to bonon, kandapanan to dalah, sinmas mailanhabas to is-ihomis hai oka mahto laovaiv, asa sain to samashaingan.
<2bnn> I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.

<2bnn> In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.
<2en> Tosingav saikin to mahtoang kata maciskon, sahal imita maisna habas to inihomisan, sahal imita to dalah, sahal amin imita vaivi sidoh to bongka. Mai-aopa mapakasial, mai-aopa moskon mihomis malisvala maidaza, taskon mai-aopa Taioan to alngangasan.
<2bnn> I call upon our entire society to come together and get to know our history, get to know our land, and get to know the cultures of our many ethnic peoples. Let us work towards reconciliation, a shared existence and shared prosperity, and a new future for Taiwan.
<2en> Tasingav saikin tasto Taioan to bonon, kanasia aip to haniancin, maciskon macintamasaz mapin- oni kokkatan mamantok mapiszang, vaivivaivi sidoh hai mapaloszang amin.
<2bnn> I call upon all citizens to seize the opportunities offered by this day - to join together, work hard, and build a country of justice, a country of true diversity and equality.

<2bnn> He kept on looking if the frog was inside.

<2bnn> That dog wants to eat the hornets.

<2bnn> He would be chased by the hornets.

<2bnn> He was still calling but still it wasn't there. Then it was deer's antlers - the deer came out.

<2bnn> Then here (on this page), the dog came out. Would it pull out frogs there?

<2bnn> And then it is barking and calling out loud.
<2en> 'oang'oang 'oang'oang 'oang 'oang.

<2bnn> He barks "woof woof woof woof."

<2bnn> It is holding the tree, and keeps on barking.

<2bnn> No! He is barking at the hornets.

<2bnn> He doesn't know, the hornet's nest will falls down the ground.
<2en> at aopa ai ai maz adii ovaz a hai sado mas lokis to.
<2bnn> Then, because the child sees that tree, that

<2bnn> There is that hole.

<2bnn> On it he sees.

<2bnn> So the frog sees the tree, there is that hole.

<2bnn> Then the kid climbs up the tree and sees a hole on the tree.

<2bnn> The kid goes up and yells at the hole.

<2en> maza dii aso hai kaz tonghabin ii aopa sininap mas sinapo s bohosaz cia saia hai inasto sia bato cia tonghabin.
<2bnn> That dog hides. Because being chased by the hornets, it hides under the rock.

<2bnn> That kid is on the rock, holding the horn-like things.

<2bnn> They turn across the dead tree and went away.

<2bnn> There is a kid who found a frog and kept it.

<2bnn> He sees it is no longer there.

<2bnn> They hug each other and consider where the frog went.

<2bnn> He says to the dog: 'We are going to look for the frog. I have no idea if it is taken away.'

<2bnn> They went outside, went everywhere, went to the river

<2bnn> She pounded the rice very strongly, but how?

<2bnn> "Chase off your wife!
<2en> tas to hanian kaz dosa to tapaz a maz a madoh a isbabazo at na mapakaon mas kaimadoh to bonon.
<2bnn> That day she only made two strings of millet pulp for the millet harvesters to eat.

<2bnn> The daughter-in-law was very sad, too ashamed to go home, because she was chased off?
<2en> at masa na modaan saia hai kikiva saia macistob mas mainangsa to madoh cia.
<2bnn> When she was about to leave, she cut millet stems for the last time.

<2en> at cinmangha maz a cina sado to maopa to cina ito mai ovaaz to sing'av a malala'la a dao.
<2bnn> The mother looked up - it sounds as if it's her child who's calling.
