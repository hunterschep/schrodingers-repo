President Tsai Ing-wen's Apology to the Indigenous Peoples on Behalf of the Government.
On this day 22 years ago, the term "shanbao" (mountain people) in the Additional Articles of our Constitution was replaced with the proper name: "indigenous people." This correction not only did away with a discriminatory term, but also highlighted the status of indigenous peoples as Taiwan's "original owners." From this basis, today, we are taking another step forward. To all indigenous peoples of Taiwan: On behalf of the government, I express to you our deepest apology. For the four centuries of pain and mistreatment you have endured, I apologize to you on behalf of the government.
I know that even now, there are some around us who see no need to apologize. But that is the most important reason why I am representing the government to issue this apology today. To see what was unfair in the past as a matter of course, or to treat the pain of other ethnic peoples as an unavoidable part of human development, this is the first mindset that we, standing here today, resolve to change and overturn.
The Dutch and the Koxinga Kingdom massacred and exploited the Pingpu ethnic group. The Qing Empire presided over bloody confrontations and suppression. Colonial Japan put in place comprehensive savage policies. And the post- war ROC government undertook assimilation policies. For 400 years, every regime that has come to Taiwan has brutally violated the rights of indigenous peoples through armed invasion and land seizure. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Indigenous peoples maintain tribal order according to traditional customs, and ecological balance according to traditional wisdom. But in the process of modern state-building, indigenous peoples lost the right to steer their own course and govern their own affairs. The fabric of traditional societies was torn apart, and the collective rights of peoples were not recognized. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Indigenous peoples had their own languages. However, with Japanese rule aiming to assimilate and turn all into imperial subjects, and with the ROC government banning tribal languages after 1945, indigenous peoples' languages suffered great losses. Most Pingpu languages have disappeared. Successive governments have been negligent in the protection of indigenous cultures. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Ever since outsiders began arriving in Taiwan, the Pingpu ethnic group on the western plains have born the brunt of the impact. One ruling power after another eroded the individual and collective identities of the Pingpu ethnic group. For this, I apologize to the Pingpu ethnic group on behalf of the government.
After the democratic transition, the country began to respond to the appeals of indigenous movements. The government made certain promises and efforts. Today, we have an Indigenous Peoples Basic Law that is quite advanced. However, government agencies have not given sufficient weight to this law. Our actions have not been fast enough, comprehensive enough or sound enough. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Taiwan is known as a culturally diverse society. But even today, indicators on health, education, economic livelihood, political participation and more still show gaps between indigenous and non- indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, stereotypes and even discrimination against indigenous peoples have not gone away. The government has not done enough, so indigenous peoples have suffered pain and frustration unknown to other ethnic peoples. For this, I apologize to the indigenous peoples on behalf of the government.
Our efforts have fallen short, and succeeding generations have been blind to this inadequacy. Because of this, your hardship has continued to this day. For this we are truly sorry. Today's apology is long overdue, but it is a beginning. I do not expect any one speech or phrase of apology to wipe away four centuries of pain and suffering by the indigenous peoples. But I do hope with all my heart that today's apology will set this country and all its people on the path towards reconciliation.
Please allow me to shed light on this occasion with a piece of indigenous wisdom. In the Atayal language, truth is called "Balay," and reconciliation is called "Sbalay," so you simply add an "S" sound to "Balay." Truth and reconciliation are in fact two related concepts. In other words, only by facing the truth sincerely can reconciliation be attained.
In indigenous cultures, when a tribe member has offended another and intends to reconcile, an elder brings together the offender and the offended - not to produce a direct apology, but to allow each side to frankly share their inner journeys. When this truth-telling concludes, the elder calls for everyone to drink together, so that what is past is truly past. This is "Sbalay."
I hope today's occasion can be a "Sbalay" between the government and the indigenous peoples. I have spoken of past mistakes and truths the best I can, with nothing held back. In a moment, our indigenous friends will speak. I do not dare ask you to forgive, here and now. But I sincerely ask you to sustain the hope that past wrongs will not be repeated, and that one day, this country can see true reconciliation.
Today is only a beginning. The duty for reconciliation lies not with the indigenous peoples and the Pingpu ethnic group, but with the government. I know that words of apology alone are not enough. What we actually do for the indigenous peoples will decide whether reconciliation succeeds or stumbles.
Therefore, I am here to announce that we are setting up an Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Commission under the Presidential Office. As the head of state, I will serve as convener and work hand in hand with tribal representatives to pursue historical justice. We will also discuss, on the basis of equality, the future policy direction of this country.
I want to stress that this commission places the greatest importance on equality between the country and the indigenous peoples. The election of tribal representatives, including for the Pingpu ethnic group, will take as basis the consensus of peoples and tribes. This commission will serve as a mechanism for collective decision-making by indigenous peoples, and will ensure that the voices of tribe members find true expression.
In addition, I will request that our Executive Yuan convene regularly the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law Promotion Committee, and use the Yuan's authority to coordinate and handle matters related to any consensus reached by the above-mentioned commission. These matters include the following: to retrieve historical memories, to promote indigenous self-government, to seek fair economic development, to ensure continuation of culture and education, to safeguard indigenous health, and to protect the rights of urban indigenous peoples, etc.
Where modern laws and indigenous traditional cultures are at odds, we will set up an Indigenous Legal Service Center with a high degree of cultural sensitivity, to reduce through institutional design the growing clashes between indigenous customs and modern laws.
I will ask the relevant agencies to immediately pull together cases in which indigenous community members have been indicted or sentenced for hunting, where the hunting was done in accordance with traditional customs, on traditional lands, and for non-transactional needs, and where the animals hunted were not protected by conservation laws. For such cases we will deliberate solutions.
I will also direct relevant agencies to present an investigative report on the decision-making process of nuclear waste storage on Orchid Island. Before finding a permanent solution for the nuclear waste, we will provide the Yami tribe appropriate compensation.
At the same time, under the principle of respecting the Pingpu ethnic group's self- identity, and recognizing their identity, we will examine relevant laws before September 30 of this year, so that Pingpu ethnic group identity will receive the rights and status it deserves.
On November 1 of this year, we will begin to delineate and announce indigenous traditional territories and lands. The system of tribal public corporation is already in place. In the future, the ideals of indigenous self-government will be realized step by step. We will step up the pace and submit for legislative deliberation three laws of great importance to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Self-Government Law, the Indigenous Peoples Land and Sea Areas Law, and the Indigenous Languages Development Law.
Later this afternoon, we will convene a national indigenous peoples administrative meeting. In that meeting, the government will elaborate on the policies. On every August 1 to come, the Executive Yuan will report to the indigenous peoples our progress on restoring historical justice and transitional justice. To implement the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law, to serve indigenous historical justice, and to lay the foundation for indigenous self- government - these are the three major goals for the government's policy towards indigenous peoples.
To all of our indigenous friends here and watching on TV and online: I invite you to stand witness. I invite you not to endorse, but to oversee. Please keep pressure on the government and right its course where necessary, so that it will realize its commitments and right historical wrongs.
I want to thank all of our indigenous friends. You remind everyone in this country that there is irreplaceable value in the land we tread on and the traditions we inherit. This value deserves dignity.
In the future, we will push for policies to ensure that succeeding generations of indigenous tribes and all ethnic peoples in Taiwan never lose their languages and memories, that they are never separated from their cultural traditions, and that never again are they lost in a land of their own.
I call upon our entire society to come together and get to know our history, get to know our land, and get to know the cultures of our many ethnic peoples. Let us work towards reconciliation, a shared existence and shared prosperity, and a new future for Taiwan.
I call upon all citizens to seize the opportunities offered by this day - to join together, work hard, and build a country of justice, a country of true diversity and equality.
Thank you all
On the mountain, there is a farmer.
And then there is a boy on his fields.
He went up to the pomelos cultivated by him.
He kept on plucking the fruit.
He put them in the bag meant for packaging.
Then there are the pomelos plucked by him, dropped on the ground.
A person who is rearing a goat passes by with it.
The goat wants to go back to eat the pomelos that had been plucked and put inside the basket.
But it is pulled away by his master.
Later, a boy rides a bike over here.
He gets to where the baskets with pomelos are.
He sees the tangerine guy up in the tree.
He even thinks about stealing a basket of pomelos.
Then he adjusts his bike and puts a basket of pomelos on his bike.
He stole it for the time being and rides his bike away.
They bumped into each other roughly, and his hat was dropped off.
He looked back, knowing nothing about the stone ahead.
The bicycle hit the stone on the wheel. Then he fell off his bike, and the pomelos were spilt out.
Picking up pomelos, two moved the basket onto the bike.
The kid put the stone away the street.
He might hurt his foot because he fell roughly.
He walked along and return the hat to its owner, the kid who had stolen the pomelos.
Then they shared one for each.
They were walking and eating the pomelos.
Then the tangerine harvester went down.
Because two of these three basket ware to get full.
There was a small boy looking at a dog and a frog.
The dog is keeping a frog in a bottle.
The boy is also looking at the frog.
There were shoes.
Here (on this page), the boy is holding the dog while sleeping.
Then the frog runs away.
On this page, the boy iss still sleeping, but the dog isn't.
Is it still in the bottle? If not, then it must be in the shoes.
It's like that.
Until here, he keeps on shouting and looking: "Where did you go?"
That frog disappeared!
Then there's only the dog looking up and calling for it.
It's not in the house. What should we do?
Then the dog also got into the bottle.
The boy kept on looking down from the window and waiting.
Then the dog also came. He held it tightly.
But there was still no trace of the frog.
Are there two of them? [boy and dog]
Here, they were still calling and leaving the house.
The two of them went together, calling out loud and looking around.
It was not there. Then in the forest they saw there was a hornet nest on the tree.
The dog wanted to climb up the whole time to eat the hornet nest.
He kept on looking if the frog was inside.
That dog wants to eat the hornets.
But the child was afraid. What should he do if he is chased since it suddenly knows?
It was pulled down... Look, suddenly they all turned their heads - those hornets that would eat us were just coming out from the nest which had dropped down.
chased the person till there. What could he do?
Would he hide in that forest? Was there a wall?
He would be chased by the hornets.
Everybody was afraid over there and kept waiting and screaming "where is our mom?"
The dog was chased because he had taken down.
As for the children, who kicked him?
Who had kicked it?
It was the owl, right?
It was kicked by the owl, right?
Then all the young people went there and tried their best to cover their head. How would it be if the hornets came? Just this way.
He was still calling but still it wasn't there. Then it was deer's antlers - the deer came out.
Will it help him?
Then how would the dog that is already on the other side get there?
He is in the mountain.
There was a deer, it keeps on calling a frog.
It kept calling the frog: "Come!" But still he didn't come.
Then there, the deer carried the child on its back.
To there, there were two birds and a nest, an empty nest.
Then, the child and the dog lay down together.
Then, on the contrary, the dog was saved by being held on his head.
The frog still hadn't come out yet.
Here, did the frog come out?
Here, the dog came out from the water and it was told not to speak because there would be frogs.
Then here (on this page), the dog came out. Would it pull out frogs there?
He kept looking over there, wondering if the frog would appear.
Then he told the dog not to bark or howl.
Then there, they went on the wood.
They became very happy because he and many children, siblings and the like were there.
There then they grabbed their mother.
Like this, like that.
They were leaving, the dog took one away.
The frog left while being held.
The dog was made to walk in front.
That's it.
that uhm
that book
We can see one child, then there is that dog.
Then because there is that frog in the bottle.
So, we can know they are at night.
Then, because that dog and child went to sleep in the bed.
The child and the dog suddenly wake up.
They inspect the bottle
We can't know where that frog went to.
So we will look for him.
Then, were did that frog go to?
That one over there.
That frog inside the bottle, but it's not there.
All of the shoes were opened and inspected to see if he went into the shoes.
That dog over there
He puts in its head.
In there, to see if the bottle where they put the frog.
But it's not there.
because
This way they won't find it.
Then
It was already the morning of the next day.
It became already morning
He woke up.
Because...uhm
The dog believed whether it was still inside.
Shouting for it.
Then the dog went down from the window.
Then it went down from the window.
Then the bottle broke.
We can see the child goes there.
He was really sad.
He immediately went down.
And they went outside holding the dog.
And kept calling and kept on searching.
He kept calling outside, but
Those hornets, if they hear human sounds
If the voices of humans disturb them
So they kept calling to the, uhm.
The dog and the child kept calling out to the frog.
They all flew out.
to where the voices were calling out.
then they all come out.
then uhm
So we can see this hole, then call out.
Then that dog sees the hive of the hornets.
And then it is barking and calling out loud.
woofwoof woofwoof woof woof
"Are you in there, frog?"
He kept on shouting
He startled.
Did this mouse come from this hole?
If we look in a more detailed manner
that mouse, it almost looks like a field mouse.
Very small.
He is on the tree.
on the tree.
There is a, it looks like it's called, the hornets.
The dog keeps barking at them.
He barks "woof woof woof woof."
It was like that.
Was that dog like that?
It is holding the tree, and keeps on barking.
No! He is barking at the hornets.
He doesn't know, the hornet's nest will falls down the ground.
Then, because the child sees that tree, that
There is that hole.
On it he sees.
So the frog sees the tree, there is that hole.
Then the kid climbs up the tree and sees a hole on the tree.
The kid goes up and yells at the hole.
That dog just made the beehive drop.
So the dog is running away chased by hornets.
That kid drops down to the ground because seeing the owl.
Then there is a rock as well as something like a tree. However, it seems to be deer's antlers when being watched carefully.
That dog hides. Because being chased by the hornets, it hides under the rock.
That kid is on the rock, holding the horn-like things.
Maybe the goat does not know where it is running is a cliff.
It stops, and the kind and dog drops from the antler down to the ground- it seems to be water.
because it can be understood as water.
Then they, the kid and dog, drops down to the water.
It looks like they dropped into the water though.
We can tell that is good.
He drops into the water and sits there. He stands up right away and carries the dog on his back.
He wants to go to the riverside.
When he goes to the riverside, there is a dead tree.
They hold the tree.
The tree seems to be a hole.
The kid worries things like that they have yelled out loud and scared the bird might happen again, so he tells the dog to be quiet.
you cannot bark!
They turn across the dead tree and went away.
They cross and see, and they are shocked.
He thinks it is good! It turns out that the frog is not lost.
He takes the frog he kept home.
Nine frogs remain now. There used to be ten.
The kid takes one home.
There are dead trees near the riverside. Frogs also like to live at the dead trees at the riverside.
There is a kid who found a frog and kept it.
He also has a dog.
They became a family.
They love the frog so much. They are a family. One night they are sleeping.
He sees it is no longer there.
"Where is the frog?," the dog keeps searching and barking.
They hug each other and consider where the frog went.
He says to the dog: 'We are going to look for the frog. I have no idea if it is taken away.'
They went outside, went everywhere, went to the river
there is a tree where they live
There is a hole there. Then the child thinks if it hid in the hole.
Over there he keeps calling: "Frog where are you?"
Then, that dog sees the hornet's nest in the tree.
He wonders, is the frog in there, too?
Then the tree was shaken. He didn't know the hornets will fly out when being shaken.
The dog hits the hornets to the ground.
I think the dog would be taken and bitten.
The hornets move that way to chase the dog, and then the child hides at the tree.
Because there is a hole he wonders if it is in there.
He founds a stone hole below and climbed up the tree and yelled: "Where are you, frog?"
All the way, those hornets will chase that dog. The dog just runs away like that and is being chased by the hornets.
Then the child is shocked and afraid because he falls down.
He climbs up the rock and anticipates the deer.
As for that antler, he thinks it is a tree.
Then he holds it, standing on the rock and yelling out "where are you, frog?"
Then that dog follows this kid hide beneath the stone, refraining from being chased by hornets.
They keep yelling like that, unaware that what they are holding onto are antlers.
It runs away with them on its back.
The dog follows its master and the deer leaves.
The deer sees there is no more roads in front.
The deers stops at the cliff, without knowing that kid is cast away because he does not hold tightly.
Being cast, they drops into the gully.
They cross the river.
arrive at the riverside and see a drift wood.
He tells the dog 'Be quiet! If you bark again as you want, bad things like what we came across when we were seeking the frog will happen.'
So they take the frog and look at it. That is the frog they kept.
One day, a farmer went to collect the pears he had planted.
He went to harvest them by himself.
He went up to collect and took the harvest like that.
He wiped the dust off to make those harvests better.
There were two basket of the collected ones.
It was not over yet; he climbed up the tree again.
Then there was a kid riding a bike like that.
It became dawn.
No one knew where the kid was going to. He went toward where they were because there was only a way.
He stopped, seeing so many pears in baskets.
He sees that there is an old man plucking.
He wants to take one piece.
To try it.
He looks again to see if the old man has seen him.
He hasn't, because the old man is plucking industriously, he doesn't know there is somebody passing by below.
He took one basket and biked away.
The old man was still harvesting in the tree.
Then the child quickly rode away on his bike just in the case he was going to be chased once the old man knew.
There was another kid also riding a bike like that, looking like went toward somewhere.
The stone road was bad.
The young boy was thinking where the pretty girl was going to. He thought the girl is so beautiful.
His leg also got hurt.
Then all children rode off, the three people also went on their way.
The boy who is following them sees that the hat belongs to that child.
He whooed him over.
He stopped.
The boy lifts the basket, and asks: Is this your hat?
He gives each person a pear to eat.
And the three children didn't know they were stolen.
They went on their way.
They happily ate while walking.
The old man finishes plucking pears, because his pockets are full.
When he wants to put in the basket, he thinks, how come one is missing?
He doesn't know how it's nowhere to be found, and didn't hear anyone pass by.
Then the old man thinks, if they were the thieves, they would have a basket.
He thinks, isn't this what was stolen, but I can't tell the children, is that what you are eating?
There was frog inside a bottle.
They had fun with the frog.
They watched each other.
Then the child fell asleep.
The frog jumped out from the bottle.
Then he was shocked to find out why the frog was not inside the bottle anymore.
Then he got up (from the bed).
He saw the shoe, wondering whether it hid still inside. No.
Then the puppy put its head into the bottle,smelling to find out where the frog was going.
#e Then the child embraced the dog, checking if it felt hurt, if it was okay or injured because of the bottle's being broken out.
Then they went out to the so-called corridor.
Then they went over there, keeping yelling: "Hey frog, where did you go?"
Before long, they kept yelling noisily there.
The kid went there to see the hole and to blow at that hole.
The dog then stared at the hornets' nest.
The mouse also showed up.
The dog was cased by the hornets, and the kid also ran away to hide.
The eagle flied after him and tried to peck and bite him.
Then they went onto the stone, and the dog hid behind.
He was chased by the hornets; maybe he was bitten. He felt so depressed there.
He hid behind the stone and the wood, not knowing the dog was still running over.
A buffalo or a deer was running after it.
The deer rans away too. Because running away, it didn't know the kid and the dog was dropped and fell.
The dog and the kid dropped into the water at the same time, and the deer was over there looking at them.
Also two frogs took a rest there.
They were happy because they found the frog.
They got together, they found the frog.
The frog family also got together around the water, the stone, or the tree holes.
Everyone is there together, and the kid finished looking for.
The kid brought over his dog.
He brought the frog he had kept back to the home and put it into the bottle.
That old man over there, he begins to pluck guavas.
Then, he goes up and harvests again. Then there is a person passing by with a goat, which he let graze.
That old man, he does not rest.
There is a child riding his bike.
He looks upward and sees that the old man is still there plucking.
If he takes one, he thinks that's okay. The old man isn't looking anyway.
He takes one basket away.
The old man is unaware so he doesn't yell and keeps plucking.
He's shocked because he sees a girl also biking over, whose hat has been blown off by the wind, and he doesn't see his tire hitting a stone, as he falls on the ground.
The guavas he took spill out.
He looks if his foot didn't get hurt.
They help him fill the basket.
After collecting, they help him put up the basket.
One child sees the hat that was blown off, and whistles over, to give him the hat.
This way, they go home while eating.
The old man is done harvesting, and goes down.
He sees, originally there were three baskets, but one is missing?
Nice to see you.
I am going to tell an ancient story.
The hunter who hunted with a dog became a bird named Dut.
Long time a ago, there was a greatly brave hunter.
It is because when hunting with a dog, a brave dog is required to help hunters chase the game.
There was a brave man who was never left behind when going dog-hunting with others.
When hunting, he caught preys the most.
He was able to get more game because he was excellent.
So much game is shot.
However since his dog kept barking while approaching the other side, he knew that the dog was chasing a big wild boar because it barked without stopping.
Then, 'Tu tu tu tu tu tu,' the hunter called the dog back.
Talum let it go, taking the net bag on his back and left for home.
While continuing to call the dog, Talum the Brave arrived home.
His dog did not follow him, and did not come back either.
His wife and children answered: 'NO.'
Then Talum the brave was considering why the dog did not come after?
He remembered that he had heard the dog barking when he was leaving.
He put down the meat he had been carrying on his back.
He went back to the forest where he had gone dog hunting right away and kept looking for the dog.
He kept yelling, because he wanted his dog back. He was going to look for his dog.
Talum the Brave put down his net bag and the meat.
He turned back right away, went back through the night to the hunting ground and kept calling the dog.
He kept calling in the mountain despite that the sky turned dark.
However, he could not go back if the dog was not found.
The day broke.
Talum the Brave got on the tree, keeping calling and looking for his dog a whole day. However, no dog came.
Three days passed, the dog that he had been looking for did not come back.
He kept calling, without eating and sleeping. Yet the dog did not come back.
Talum the Brave was so sad. He missed the dog very much, the dog he treasured the most.
In the tree he became very sad of a sudden, wondering what should he do.
Three days passed unconsciously.
He was hungry and hard and had no power.
He was weak on the tree, and then he died.
After three days passed, his wife wondered where Talum the Brave was, why not come back home after looking for dog for three days.
Then indeed the cousins went to the mountain where Talum usually goes to.
No answers thought.
They went uphill. They looked up, seeing something kept crying 'duduut' in the tree.
Then they looked upward and wondered what was crying 'Duduut'.
Oh! They saw a big bird kept crying 'DUDUUT' on the branch.
Duut duut.
In fact, they saw, and all of a sudden the knew that was a bird Talum the Brave had become.
That, this,...
I see there is a tree, and
There is a ladder.
He is busy plucking pears from on the tree, and then
drops the pears [in the basket].
And then...
He takes them and puts them in
in the basket.
Then he would have had many fruits.
Many fruits
How should one see this?
what we are being made to watch.
There are some people over there.
They make them take, aah, no.
'they lead away a goat in passing'
There is
If there is
We have a saying that says:
Don't
Uhm, casually take
Those other fruits.
We see a youth riding a bike.
I don't know what he's doing.
Hey, wait a minute!
He's going to do.
Oh, apparently, uhm
Those children
Bad intentions
stealing
Those children, with their bad intentions, steal a basket of the pears.
So if we see that, uhm, if he makes a mistake by stealing
Then they met with that boy there.
Then the pears that were stolen all fell.
But fortunately
But fortunately there is a family, a woman and two children, who meets the boy on the road.
Then the good child gives it back.
Maybe he said:
It can be seen that that child is not very greedy.
Because the three of them, if we were to look at it, that child could, help them take the hat, if they were asking for it.
give it back so, uh, he can demand
Uhm, dema- demand
He gave it back, so he can demand from that child three pears.
[His] hand, then, uhm
Maybe all of them over there, the old man who was plucking pears, what stupid thing is this?!
Then that movie clip that you made [people] see.
In the beginning, why is is is there that person, taking the goat, walking on the road, what's been said?
There is this...
Uhm, how do intelligent people say this?
Don't
And that's all.
Hello, I want to talk about a legendary story from long ago.
A long time ago, there was a legend that said there was a very lazy daughter-in-law who did work slowly.
She had been chased away by her husband and turned in a bird on the road home.
One day, there was a daughter-in-law.
Then, as for the master of the family of the daughter-in-law, because the daughter-in-law was lazy and slow, her in-laws made her stay at home.
Her husband also went along with all of them to harvest millet.
It already got to the noon but she hadn't even finished stripping one string.
She pounded the rice very strongly, but how?
By the evening, she still hadn't finished pounding one string of rice.
The rice that mother had taken down.
But then the people who were harvesting came home.
All of the people helping farming came home to eat.
And the mother came home.
We the harvesters have come back.
You need to finish harvesting the millet of a the whole row, before you can co home and eat.
She went over and saw, ai, in the mortar the unpounded millet was hidden.
Snoring while sleeping!
But doesn't even know how to cook!
The mother was very angry.
The father, all the people who came to help, all were very angry.
I don't want you anymore!
Then she tells the husband:
"Chase off your wife!
That day she only made two strings of millet pulp for the millet harvesters to eat.
But she didn't cook, didn't finish pounding.
The daughter-in-law was chased away by them.
Then that night, she was driven away.
I don't there going back home.
In the past, if you were married
you couldn't go back to one's elderly home without reason.
Except for when your parents would call you to come home.
The daughter-in-law was very sad, too ashamed to go home, because she was chased off?
When she was about to leave, she cut millet stems for the last time.
Because she was very skinny, and didn't have any meat.
She bound them into a shin pads.
She went into the deep night.
She was on the road until dawn broke.
She went away, we chased her off, because she was of no use.
She was at home, because she can't work.
We asked her to go home.
"But she didn't get back home!"
Her daughter did not make it back home.
When they took a better look at them, oh, they resembled the daughter's shin pads a lot.
Because when she was getting married
The mother had made these shin pads for her.
and had given her the traditional Bunun clothes to wear.
They picked it up, the mother studied and, oh my god, they were here shin pads.
Why is like this, where is she?
She was on the top of the mountain, and kept on calling: where are you? where are you?
The mother kept calling like that for her child.
All of a sudden there was a voice coming from a tree: "Only a whisper remains, only a whisper remains."
The mother looked up - it sounds as if it's her child who's calling.
I am your mother.
I will take you home.
The mother lifted her head, and saw a bird in the trees.
It kept on calling, "only a whisper, only a whisper remains."
It turns out she meant that she didn't have any strength left to go home.
Only a whisp of my strength remains.
The mother looked up and saw that she had become a bird, and kept on calling in the tree, only a whisp remained.
After the bird [she] became a bird
the mother was sad and went home, but...
This kind of bird is still in the woods.
If people go into the woods on the mountains, they will hear that kind of birdcall, "lapus 'ang'ang, lapus 'ang'ang."
The Bunun people gave it the name "Lapus 'ang'ang".
I am going to narrate, about the previous ancestral story.
What he planted the most satisfying one is the pear
he planted pears, then the pears were fruitful
one day he thought of going to harvest the pears he planted
then, he carried his three baskets to load the pears
He enthusiastically picking the pears from the early morning he gathered for two baskets the two baskets were full
he thought there was still one basket hadn't filled yet it was better to also load it because the pears he planted was extremely fruitful
there was a kid coming up he rode a bicycle passing through the old man's baskets.
he didn't see that old man
he thought it was better to steal a full basket
he thought wow I brought back home a basket of pears
meanwhile his hat also fell off
when he fell off the bicycle pears in the basket also spilled out
he was on the road sitting down to see his bleeding knee bleeding
he squatted down and keep rubbing his knee
but those three kids really helped that kid they helped him picked up the scattered pears

one of them at the same time throw the stone away throw it away across the street
they thought if there were other people passed through they might fall off like him

I am going to talk about the legends of the ancestors again.
One day, there is a child. He kept a dog.
He was always happy, playing with the frog he caught in the bottle.
One night he was going to sleep.
He would enjoyed the frog every day.
Then he slept with his dog held in his arms.
He also let [his dog] to sleep in the bed.
These two were on the bed together.
The kid thought that the frog was put into the bottle.
Then they fell asleep.
He was shocked, "Why did the frog I caught disappear?"
The dog also stood up and looked. 'Alas, it truly disappeared.'
He got out of bed right away and looked for the frog he fostered in the bottle.
He also sifted through his slippers and shoes.
Maybe the frog just went inside the shoes?
Alas, no.
Then that dog also helped to look for the frog.
The dog got its head stuck in the bottle, smelling around and looking for where the frog was.
The dog got its head stuck inside the bottle.
The dog put its head inside the bottle and could not get it out.
The kid was also shocked and said "What am I going to do?"
Then the kid thought it is impossible to remove the bottle stuck to the dog's neck.
He thought he was going to drop the dog.
Wow! Really!
He dropped the dog from the window like that.
After dropping it, the bottle really broke, and the dog's head got out.
He yells and looks for his frog.
"where are you, frog?"
Then, they keep yelling.
Then, the dog sees a suspended hornet hive.
The dog thinks about climbing up to the tree, and keeps shaking the hornet hive.
Then the kid looks inside the hole on the ground.
That kid is shocked. "Oops!"
The rat goes out and says "What is so noisy and keeps on yelling!"
The kid is startled too.
Then that dog goes up.
It keeps shaking the tree.
There is a hornet hive hanging.
Then that kid hides in, on the tree.
He hides on the branches. What should he do if being chased by hornets.
Then that dog hides away, runs away.
Although the dog runs away with all-out effort, it is chased by the hornets.
Then when the kid hides on the tree, it turns out there is a hole there.
Oops! There turns out to be a huge eagle there.
An eagle all of a sudden shows up, that sees the kid and wants to catch him.
Then the kid hides (and thinks about) "What on earth should I do? I am going to be pecked by the eagle"
He holds his head "What should I do? My head will be pecked!"
He seems to see a huge rock.
He climbs up and hides there, without knowing it is a huge deer.
Then he gets onto the deer's head, seizing antlers tightly.
He yells "Who are you? Where are you? Do you know the frog?" Then, at the same time his dog hides too.
He yells and looks for.
That deer keep running.
The kid falls into a big river in the valley.
Oops! That kid sees they drops into the water.
A bright idea suddenly occurs to him, he thinks about carrying the dog across his shoulders.
Then they go along with the river flow.
They see a big trunk existing.
Then they go up and see. The dog also gets onto the wood.
They look down from the top.
Aw! They can truly see a couple of frogs, frog father and frog mother.
They keep calling and singing wonderfully.
It turns out to be its son.
He has so many siblings living together.
Those frogs are singing happily there.
I will make it a good living place.
Then they leave, they wish one another all good.
He has a dog called Kulu.
They are keeping a frog, which was put inside a bottle.
When little Dahu is sleeping, the frog he kept is worrying and wondering why he was put inside and where his buddies are.
He comes out of the bottle and runs away.
That Kulu gets his head inside the bottle, smelling and looking for the frog.
Then with Kulu, together they look for the frog from the window.
The dog brings the bottle down to the ground.
The bottle breaks.
Then the two of them, with his Kulu, go outside and keep on looking for the frog they kept.
They keep calling for him. No answers.
Then, that Little Dahu, he looks in that hole to check if the little frog went inside it.
That Little Dahu climbs on the tree, wondering if the frog ran off onto the tree.
As for the dog, the nest is dropped down by the dog, and all the hornets spread out, chasing and biting the dog.
He grips the tree, keeping on shouting out for the frog he is looking for.
But that place where he is holding the tree, it turns out to be the antlers of a wild deer.
He puts Little Dahu on his antlers and runs off toward the river.
He tosses Little Dahu off, and then kicks that small dog off.
Little Dahu and Kulu drop into the water of the river.
Then, in the water, Little Dahu takes Kulu up and carries it to the riverbank.
Then they arrived at the trees by the shore.
Little Dahu tells Kulu again with a gesture: "Don't bark, don't be noisy, or the hornets will come and bite us!"
Then they are resting on the tree.
His dog, Kulu, is very happy too.
They take a bow to the frogs being together.
Thank you!

This holiday, my sister and I went to Taitung to visit my uncle.
We took the train from Taipei to Taitung.
The station is not far from my uncle's house, and it's just a short drive away.
There is a big ranch near my uncle's house, and we rode bicycles to the ranch together.
In the ranch, my uncle took us to feed the sheep and ride horses.
In the evening, we went to the city to have dinner together.
There are a lot of cars in the city, so we go there by motorcycle.
When we were about to leave, we found that the motorcycle had been stolen, so we had to leave by bus.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
When we were young, our family lived in Naihumpu. After I started school, we moved to Puli and have been living in the city ever since.
After I went to college, I took a course on aboriginal culture and learned that the aboriginal people in Taiwan have various and rich cultures.
So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in Bunun, as well as Hokkien and Japanese.
I asked him to find out that he learned Japanese when he was a child, his wife is an Bunun, and he knows many Hokkien at work, so he can speak so many languages.
Although we could't fully understand it, we could record it on our cell phones and listen to it more.
The more I know, the more I feel that being a Bunun is unique and something to be proud of.
My younger brother is going home this evening.
My grandma and I went to the market to buy chickens and prepared a delicious dinner for my younger brother.

The owner of the nearby fruit stand said: "My pineapples and peaches are very sweet. Buy some!"
We bought pineapples and peaches.
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
Grandma thought it was too expensive and asked the boss if it could be cheaper.
But the boss said that it is already very cheap and cannot be reduced any further.
In the end we bought chicken and fish, and went home to cook a table of food.
After waiting for a long time, it was already dark.
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
I have a classmate named Tiang, he often forgets to bring things.
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
But he has a bad habit of often borrowing things but not returning them.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
One day, we all went on an outing together.
On the way, Tiang wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
He borrowed toilet paper from his classmates, but everyone told him that I didn't bring them either.
Tiang aw burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
The classmate told him, because you didn't bring it yourself, and you wouldn't return the things lent to you!
The next day at school, Tiang arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
Tiang apologized to the students and said that he would definitely bring his own things in the future, and thanked the classmates for their willingness to lend him things before.
My dad is a hunter of the tribe.
When I was little, my dad and uncle would go out at night with hunting knives and guns.
At daybreak, they returned with their prey.
Sometimes it was a boar, sometimes a flying squirrel, and occasionally a pheasant.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Dad saw it and told me that I will be a very good hunter in the future.
Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.
When returning to the village, share the hunted prey with the tribe.
Dad said, we want to thank the ancestors for their blessings, so that we have a lot of prey to harvest.

We had arranged to visit his home this holiday for the interview.
During the interview, he introduced to me the origin of his name and also introduced me to his family and tribe.
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
Taupas Suqluman said, \The names written in indigenous languages are our true names. My name represents our ethnic group
Yesterday, I went to the market with my grandmother to set up a stall. My grandmother brought a lot of vegetables that she grew herself and also prepared indigenous cuisine for everyone.
Everyone loved my grandmother's stall. Many people bought the chilis and African eggplants, and many people came to taste the dishes she cooked.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
Seeing my grandmother's passion for traditional food, I feel very proud and honored.

I hope the typhoon doesn't come, I still want to go out to play again.
My school is next to our house, I walk to school every day, and I also walk home.

We have to clean every day, and everyone has to clean the classroom.

Yesterday, I went to visit my grandpa in the tribe.
We haven't seen each other for a long time and I miss him a lot.

This holiday, my sister and I went to Taitung to visit my uncle.
We took the train from Taipei to Taitung.
When we arrived in Taitung, my uncle drove to the station to pick us up.
The station is not far from my uncle's house, and it's just a short drive away.
In the ranch, my uncle took us to feed the sheep and ride horses.
In the evening, we went to the city to have dinner together.
There are a lot of cars in the city, so we go there by motorcycle.
When we were about to leave, we found that the motorcycle had been stolen, so we had to leave by bus.
Now that we are back in Taipei, I don't know if my uncle's motorcycle has been found.
When we were young, our family lived in Bahu'an. After I started school, we moved to Taipei and have been living in the city ever since.
After I went to college, I took a course on aboriginal culture and learned that the aboriginal people in Taiwan have various and rich cultures.
So this summer, my brother and I went back to our tribe to visit the elderly, hoping to understand the culture of our own ethnic group.
The old man is already eighty years old, but he still looks like a middle-aged man.
I asked him which languages he knew, and he was fluent in Bunun, as well as Pangcah, Hakka and Hokkien.
I asked him to find out that he learned Pangcah when he was a child, his wife is an Hakka, and he knows many Hokkien at work, so he can speak so many languages.
During our interview, the old man talked about a lot of traditional knowledge about hunting.
Although we could't fully understand it, we could record it on our cell phones and listen to it more.
When I was young, I didn't understand the culture of my ethnic group, and I was a little embarrassed that I was an aborigine.
The more I know, the more I feel that being a Bunun is unique and something to be proud of.
My younger brother is going home this evening.
We passed the vegetable stand, which had a lot of fresh green vegetables.
We bought water spinach, yams and carrots.
We bought pineapples and peaches.
We passed the meat stall, and the boss said, "What do you want to buy? Today's chickens are big and fat, and one is 300 NTD."
Grandma thought it was too expensive and asked the boss if it could be cheaper.
But the boss said that it is already very cheap and cannot be reduced any further.
The boss next door said, come and buy my fish, my fish is big and cheap.
In the end we bought chicken and fish, and went home to cook a table of food.
The younger brother called back and said that the army suddenly couldn't take a vacation and would not be back until the next Sunday.
Grandma said that she has cooked so much, so let's eat together!
We invited friends and family to have a great dinner together.
I have a classmate named Lumav, he often forgets to bring things.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
But he has a bad habit of often borrowing things but not returning them.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
One day, we all went on an outing together.
On the way, Lumav wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
He borrowed toilet paper from his classmates, but everyone told him that I didn't bring them either.
Lumav burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
The next day at school, Lumav arrived at school early and returned everything he had borrowed from his classmates.
Lumav apologized to the students and said that he would definitely bring his own things in the future, and thanked the classmates for their willingness to lend him things before.
My dad is a hunter of the tribe.
When I was little, my dad and uncle would go out at night with hunting knives and guns.
Sometimes it was a boar, sometimes a flying squirrel, and occasionally a pheasant.
They would divide the prey at the entrance of the village and share it with the tribe.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
Dad said that he would take me with me when I grew up.
The men of the tribe also trap their prey, making lasso traps and rock traps.
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Dad saw it and told me that I will be a very good hunter in the future.
When returning to the village, share the hunted prey with the tribe.
I was late for school this morning.
When I was going to school, I forgot to bring my backpack.

During the interview, he introduced to me the origin of his name and also introduced me to his family and tribe.
I asked him why he insisted on changing his name. Wasn't the old registration method sufficient?
He told me that using Chinese characters could not accurately convey his name, and others would still call him \Xi Xian Sheng
Everyone loved my grandmother's stall. Many people bought the chilis and African eggplants, and many people came to taste the dishes she cooked.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
Our goods sold out quickly, and my grandmother said, \It's all thanks to your help.\""
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.

We invited friends and family to have a great dinner together.
During class, he borrowed pencils, erasers or notebooks from his classmates.
Once, twice, three times, everyone would lend him something.
But he has a bad habit of often borrowing things but not returning them.
In the end, no one wanted to borrow anything from him.
One day, we all went on an outing together.
On the way, Qanciaz wanted to go to the bathroom, but he forgot to bring toilet paper.
He borrowed toilet paper from his classmates, but everyone told him that I didn't bring them either.
Qanciaz burst into tears. He said angrily, why don't everyone lend me toilet paper!
When I was little, my dad and uncle would go out at night with hunting knives and guns.
At daybreak, they returned with their prey.
Sometimes it was a boar, sometimes a flying squirrel, and occasionally a pheasant.
They would divide the prey at the entrance of the village and share it with the tribe.
Every time I quarreled with my father, I wanted to go hunting with my father.
Dad said that he would take me with me when I grew up.
My dad is very good at making lasso traps. Dad said that this is used to catch pheasants. We have to carefully observe the footprints of the prey, and the traps should be placed on the path of the prey.
In order to go hunting with adults as soon as possible, I practiced making traps every day, and soon my traps can really catch prey.
Dad saw it and told me that I will be a very good hunter in the future.
Now that I have grown up, I carry my bow and arrows and go hunting with my father.
When returning to the village, share the hunted prey with the tribe.
I was late for school this morning.
When I was going to school, I forgot to bring my backpack.
I didn't bring anything with me.
During class, I and my classmates read the textbook together.
During the exam, a classmate lent me a pen and an eraser.
The teacher told me, Wake up earlier next time and don't be late again!""
We study together in the Ququaz tribe.
We often listen to the elders telling stories together, and we both can speak the Bunun proficiently.
I am tall and overweight, while Tanpilic is short and thin.
Tanpilic is very energetic, and everyone likes him a lot.
Today was the school's sports day, and the school organized many competitions.
There were tug of war, soccer, running, dancing, and archery.
I participated in the running competition.
When I was running, I fell down, and my knees were bleeding.
But I stood up and continued running forward.
Everyone was happy when I reached the finish line.
He told us that there was a hole in the roof of his house.
He fell off the roof while repairing it.
My father brought beef and betel nuts for my uncle.
Before I left, my uncle praised me for growing taller and becoming more handsome.
I said, When your foot gets better
In 2022, the government announced that indigenous identification cards can include tribal names separately.
We had arranged to visit his home this holiday for the interview.
During the interview, he introduced to me the origin of his name and also introduced me to his family and tribe.
Yesterday, I went to the market with my grandmother to set up a stall. My grandmother brought a lot of vegetables that she grew herself and also prepared indigenous cuisine for everyone.
Everyone loved my grandmother's stall. Many people bought the chilis and African eggplants, and many people came to taste the dishes she cooked.
The ferns and sticky rice she cooked were delicious, as well as the braised pork with maqaw pepper and wild boar meat. The flavors attracted many customers, and everyone lined up at our stall.
While my grandmother was cooking, I was on the side attracting customers. I shouted, \The vegetables are self-grown
Our goods sold out quickly, and my grandmother said, \It's all thanks to your help.\""
Through this event, I learned about indigenous plants and food and experienced the hard work of running a stall.
Seeing my grandmother's passion for traditional food, I feel very proud and honored.
